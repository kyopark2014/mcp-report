NCT04417127,Harambee: Integrated Community-based HIV/NCD Care & Microfinance Groups in Kenya,"The objective of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness and longer-term sustainability of a differentiated care delivery model for improving HIV treatment outcomes. The central hypothesis is that the integration of community-based HIV and NCD care with group microfinance will improve retention in care and rates of viral suppression (VS) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Kenya via two mechanisms: improved household economic status and easier access to care.The specific aims are as follows:1. To evaluate the extent to which integrated community-based HIV care with group microfinance affects retention in care and VS among n=900 PLHIV in rural western Kenya using a cluster randomized intervention design of n=40 existing (fully HIV+) microfinance groups to receive either: (A) integrated community-based HIV and NCD care or (B) standard care. Data from the two trial arms will be augmented with a matched contemporaneous control group of n=300 patients receiving standard care and not involved in microfinance (group C), comparing outcomes in groups A, B and C. The hypothesize is that A \> B \> C in terms of viral suppression and retention in care.2. To identify specific mechanisms through which microfinance and integrated community-based care impact VS. Using a mixed methods approach, the study will characterize the mechanisms of effect on patient outcomes. Investigators will conduct quantitative mediation analysis to examine two main mediating pathways (household economic conditions and easier access to care), as well as exploratory mechanisms (food security, social support, HIV- related stigma). Investigators will also use qualitative methods and multi-stakeholder panels to contextualize implementation of the intervention.3. To assess the cost-effectiveness of microfinance and integrated community-based care delivery to maximize future policy and practice relevance of this promising intervention strategy. The working hypothesis is that the differentiated model will be cost-effective in terms of cost per HIV suppressed person-time, cost per patient retained in care, and cost per disability-adjusted life year saved.The main expected outcomes will be rigorous evidence of effectiveness, mechanisms and cost-effectiveness of a differentiated model for achieving the last key step in the HIV care continuum. These results are expected to have an important positive impact in terms of improved, high-quality services that address known individual and structural barriers to care and promote long-term sustainability of care for PLHIV in rural settings with high HIV prevalence.",HIV/AIDS|Noncommunicable Diseases|Hypertension|Diabetes

NCT05143827,Glycemic Index of Pasta From Traditional and Current Wheat Varieties,"This randomized, cross-over study compares pasta produced with three different wheat varieties (Senatore Cappelli, Korasan, Claudio). Patients with type 2 diabetes with no pharmacological treatment will be randomized to three different sequences, and asked to eat a standard portion of pasta on three different occasions, four days apart. 3-hour post-prandial interstitial glucose profiles will be recorded using trans-cutaneous sensors.",Diabetes Type 2
NCT01462227,Effect of Naltrexone on Counterregulatory Mechanisms in Hypoglycemia,"Insulin treatment often causes the blood glucose levels to fall too low. The body usually responds to low blood glucose levels by releasing hormones which act against the insulin to help correct the low blood glucose levels. However, this hormone response can be altered in people with diabetes. Currently there are no therapeutic agents that can be used to improve the recovery from hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Naltrexone is a tablet used to help people who are addicted to alcohol or morphine-based drugs to remain drug and alcohol-free but it can also affect the levels of the hormones which are released during hypoglycemia. The aim of this study is to determine whether naltrexone can be used to improve and accelerate the recovery from hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes.",Hypoglycemia

NCT04945473,Gastric Recalibration After Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty,"Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a technique used for bariatric surgery, with results comparable to conventional surgery, in order to treat morbid obesity. It has also less risks of complications, and it is not an irreversible technique. It can be repeated overtime, regarding the evolution of the gastroplasty. There is little data in the literature on the effectiveness of endoscopic ""revision"". This study will assess the benefits and costs of a revision during the follow-up endoscopy.",Morbid Obesity
NCT00609973,Ciprofloxacin for the Prevention of Postoperative Endoscopic Recurrence in Crohn's Disease,"Despite extensive medical treatment, surgical resection is required in approximately 70% of the patients at some time. However, recurrence of the disease after operation occurs in the majority of patients and is a serious limitation of surgical management. Therapeutic options to maintain postoperative clinical remission are urgently needed. Several drugs including mesalazine, antibiotics (metronidazole, ornidazole) and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine have been studied in the past. But the efficacy is very limited (mesalazine), overshadowed by intolerability during long-term therapy (metronidazole, ornidazole) or inconclusive (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine). Research demonstrating the absence of inflammation in patients with diverting ileostomy and the clinical benefit of a postoperative antibiotic therapy using metronidazole or ornidazole implicates a role of the resident bacterial flora in the postoperative relapse. Ciprofloxacin has a broad antibacterial spectrum. More interestingly it also suppresses E. coli strains, which can be found in high numbers in early and chronic ileal lesions of Crohn's disease patients Ciprofloxacin has demonstrated beneficial effects in the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases, but the available data of the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin allow only a very limited judgement of the safety and tolerability of a 6 months therapy of ciprofloxacin. Therefore an exploratory multicenter prospective, placebo-controlled trial is planned to analyze the safety and tolerability of a 6 months therapy with ciprofloxacin compared to placebo in 40 patients (randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio) undergoing ileocecal resection (or resection of parts of the colon). If this therapeutic regimen demonstrates tolerability, a second larger study improving the superiority of ciprofloxacin versus placebo can be initiated.",Crohn's Disease

The data may provide an insight into the use of Glucophage XR® in routine clinical practice in Thailand.",Diabetes Mellitus Type 2|GI Side Effect
NCT03679273,Nutritional Supplement on Wound Healing in Diabetic Foot,"Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is the leading cause of non-traumatic limb loss in adult worldwide. One of the major causes of limb loss in patients with DFU is poor wound healing. It is known that nutrition plays a key role in wound healing, not only because of the required calories, but more importantly for collagen remodeling by specific amino acids (arginine, glutamine, and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate).Nevertheless, few studies have investigated nutritional supplements in patients with poor wound healing of DFU. Difficulties in assessing the severity of a wound and poor adherence to drug and food supplements at home may be important factors for the negative results shown in a most recent prospective randomized controlled trial. The diabetic foot center in Chang Gung Memorial hospital has extensive experience in caring for patients with limb-threatening DFU and we recently reported that poor nutritional status in our patients correlated to poor treatment outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and possible molecular mechanisms in nutritional treatment for limb-threatening DFU. A total of 70 patients will be enrolled and randomized into study and control groups. All subjects will receive standard care. Additional amino acid supplements containing arginine, glutamine, and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate or a control (high protein formula powder) will be given orally twice a day for 21 days, and the percentage change in wound size will then be measured. Complete healing time, recurrence or major adverse cardiac events will be recorded during one year of follow up. Data on wound size, nutritional status, and levels of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, nutrient molecules (measured by ABSOLUTE/DQ P180 KIT (LC MS/MS) will be recorded before and after the nutritional supplementation. In addition, the pioneer factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) that binds native chromatin and bookmarks genomic regions for transcriptional activity may play a role in nutritional supplements in acute stressed diabetic patients. Therefore, we intend to conduct a pilot study on the for FOXA2 gene in maintaining glucose homeostasis in diabetic foot patients after nutritional interventions.",Diabetic Foot
NCT02390973,Surgery Versus Best Medical Management for the Long Term Remission of Type 2 Diabetes and Related Diseases (REMISSION),"Bariatric surgery procedures induce weight loss through restriction and/or malabsorption. The mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes remission and others metabolic improvements after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) have not yet been formally studied. The investigators propose a longitudinal study with the overall objective of measuring the long-term impact of these three bariatric surgeries (RYGB, SG, BPD-DS) on metabolic, renal and cardiovascular fate in patients with type 2 diabetes. The investigators overall hypothesis is that some bariatric procedures generate hitherto unrecognized effects on many disease-related outcomes, which greatly contributes to their beneficial impact in diabetic patients. The investigators propose 3 specific aims: 1) to establish the long term effect of the three surgeries on the metabolic recovery and quality of life in groups of diabetic patients treated with insulin, hypoglycemic agents or diet; 2) to establish the long term impact of the three surgeries on renal and cardiovascular functions in subgroup of patients with these conditions; 3) to compare metabolic impact of surgeries to those of best medical care for diabetes in a non-surgical control group. For most severely obese patients, lifestyle interventions, perhaps effective in inducing short-lived weight losses, are ineffective for long-term weight loss maintenance and durable metabolic recovery. The increasing popularity of obesity surgeries calls for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This is especially true and urgent when considering that knowledge on the relative impact of each procedure (i.e. SG vs. RYGB and BPD-DS) in resolving T2D is still limited. Better knowledge on each of the procedures will allow stronger scientific rationale for selecting the right surgery for the right patient and improve care for the severely obese individual.",Bariatric Surgery Candidate|Diabetes
NCT05214573,Second-line Therapies for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Moderate Cardiovascular Disease Risk,"We will use the target trial framework for causal inference to conduct this observational retrospective cohort study that uses claims data of adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) included in the de-identified datasets of OptumLabs Data Warehouse (OLDW) and Medicare fee-for-service.In Aim 1, we will emulate a target trial comparing the effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), and sulfonylureas (SU) in adults with T2D at moderate risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with regard to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), expanded MACE, microvascular complications, severe hypoglycemia, and other adverse events.In Aim 2, we will compare these four drug classes in the same population of adults with T2D included in OLDW and Medicare fee-for-service data with respect to a set of composite outcomes identified by a group of patients with T2D as being most important to them. Specifically, in Aim 2A, we will prospectively elicit patient preferences toward various treatment outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, kidney disease) using a participatory ranking exercise, then use these rankings to generate individually weighted composite outcomes. Then, in Aim 2B, we will estimate patient-centered treatment effects of four different second-line T2D medications that reflect the patient's value for each outcome.In Aim 3, we will compare different medications within each of the four therapeutic classes with respect to MACE.",Type 2 Diabetes|Cardiac Disease
NCT05702931,Semaglutide Treatment for Hyperglycaemia After Renal Transplantation,"Background: Post-transplant hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in renal transplant recipients within the first two weeks after transplantation. Standard-of-care is primarily based on insulin treatment with the adherent risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Semaglutide produces an effective lowering of plasma glucose in diabetes patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and leads to a reduction in weight and the incidence of hypoglycaemia. The efficacy of semaglutide is untested in renal transplant recipients, and safety concerns remain, primarily on renal graft function.Objectives: The primary objective is to establish whether tablet semaglutide (Rybelsus) compared with placebo, both as add-on to standard-of-care, is non-inferior in regulating plasma glucose in patients with hyperglycaemia after renal transplantation. Secondary objectives aim to evaluate the effect of tablet semaglutide on renal graft function, weight, use of insulin, cardiovascular parameters and safety parameters (plasma semaglutide concentration, gastrointestinal side effects, dose of immunosuppressants).Design: An investigator-initiated, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel-group, randomised trial.Population: Patients (n = 104) with post-transplant hyperglycaemia and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \> 15 ml/min/1.73 m2.Methods: Participants diagnosed with post-transplant hyperglycaemia, 10 to 15 days post-transplant, will be randomised 1:1 to either 14 weeks of tablet semaglutide once daily or placebo both as add-on to standard glucose-lowering therapy. Participants will maintain weekly contact with the clinic during the first five weeks and at two to four weeks intervals during the remaining study period. During the trial, each patient will be monitored according to blood laboratory values with safety assessed at every visit by a nephrologist. Pre-prandial plasma glucose will be measured in the morning and evening to adjust glucose-lowering therapy after consultation with an endocrinologist. Double blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) will be performed for 10-14 days from baseline and at weeks 5, 9, and 13.Primary endpoint:- Mean sensor glucose (mmol/L) evaluated by CGMKey secondary endpoints:* Incidence of hypoglycaemia* Body weight (kg)* Creatinine (μmol/L)* Daily insulin dose (IE per day)* Plasma concentration of semaglutide (nmol/L)* Blood concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus (μg/L)",Hyperglycemia|Renal Transplant Complication Primary Non-Function|Diabetes
NCT05890131,Implementation of SGLT-2 Inhibitors in Patients With Heart Failure Through a New Digital Strategy,"The implementation of new medical therapies and guidelines, is a long and complex process that takes up to 10 years on average. This prolonged process is a global challenge and is mainly due to the complexity of cross-institutional patient care, involving primary care, out-patient clinics, nursing homes and patient associations.The main objective of this clinical trial is to determine whether a new digital strategy that employs official digital letters to inform and invite patients to evaluate their eligibility for new therapies, specifically the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor for heart failure patients, can facilitate and optimise the implementation. The aim is to increase the number of eligible patients with heart failure who start taking SGLT-2 inhibitors and reduce the time it takes to initiate treatment compared to the current process. Ultimately, this approach may improve patient outcomes.",Heart Failure

NCT04540731,Multicenter Registry of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease worldwide affecting as much as 25% of the world's population. The spectrum of NAFLD ranges from non-alcoholic fatty liver to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the latter being associated with a progressive course towards fibrosis and a higher risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with type 2 diabetes are particularly at higher risk of developing fibrosis and advanced liver disease. Since NASH and its consequences will only occur in a minority of patients, it is of paramount importance to identify this population to offer them proper care.It is well known that there is a lack of awareness about the potential consequences of NAFLD, not only in the general population but also in the medical community. Patients with NAFLD are frequently lost during follow up and, additionally, approach to these patients is sub-optimal and heterogeneous among physicians.An attractive approach to applying best medical practices to patients with NAFLD is to generate a multicentre registry. Clinical registries comprise a set of systematic collected and stored data focused on a specific condition. The information stored in a registry provides relevant information about a disease and, through a process of error detection, ensures data quality and reliability. A NAFLD registry is an essential tool for providing relevant information such as epidemiological aspects of the disease, outcomes, and treatment effectiveness. As far as we concern, this would be the first registry of NAFLD in our region, a region where the disease behaves in a more aggressive way in comparison with other regions and hemispheres.By generating this registry, we are confident that we will obtain objective information on the characteristic of patients with NAFLD in our region, not only of the disease characteristics but also of social determinants that might influence disease outcomes. By being a prospective study, it allows an adequate patient follow up.",Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
NCT00645827,Use of an Insulin Infusion Conversion Equation (IICE) to Control Blood Glucose in Hospitalized Patients,"Insulin infusions are commonly used in hospitalized diabetics to control blood sugar, and they are effective. However, insulin infusions require the use of limited resources. Insulin infusions are therefore changed to insulin shots as a patient recovers. Once an insulin infusion is stopped and shots are started, blood sugar control is harder to maintain. This is, in part, because physicians have different ideas on how to dose insulin shots in hospitalized patients. A math equation has been developed by the research staff that attempts to predict the effective doses of insulin shots in patients whose insulin infusion have just been stopped. The math equation was developed for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this study, all patients will be treated with the same type of insulin shots, with doses of the insulin shots chosen either by the math equation or by the judgment of the patient's physician. The study will then follow blood sugar values for 24 hours to see if the math equation is effective. If the equation is proven to be effective, a new tool will exist for physicians to determine the best dose of insulin shots for type 2 diabetics. Such a tool would, in turn, allow for widespread use of insulin infusions to determine a patient's insulin needs before discharge from the hospital. Blood sugar control for type 2 diabetics that are inpatient or outpatient would improve as a result, with potentially far reaching public health benefits.","Glucose, Blood"
NCT01954927,Pain Management in Children and Young Adults With Sickle Cell Disease,"This is a phase II double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial evaluating the effect of gabapentin when added to standard pain management for patients with sickle cell disease experiencing acute pain crisis in the ambulatory care setting.Sickle cell pain is different for every patient. Some patients get complete relief from routine pain medicines, and others need more time or more doses of pain medicines before the pain goes away completely. It is known that humans have many types of pain, including something called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain in other conditions (such as diabetes) has been treated successfully with a medicine called gabapentin. The investigators in this study suspect that some sickle cell pain is a combination of pain types. They would like to see if adding gabapentin to the usual pain medicines makes pain go away faster or more completely.Primary Objective:* To assess the analgesic efficacy of gabapentin vs. placebo for pain during vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) in participants with sickle cell disease (SCD). A response to study drug will be defined by a decrease in pain score of ≥ 33% between presentation to the acute care setting and assessment at 3 hours post administration of study drug.Secondary Objective:* To compare the total morphine equivalent dose (mg/kg) used to control pain during VOC between presentation to the acute care setting and assessment at 3 hours post administration of study drug in the gabapentin vs. placebo groups.",Sickle Cell Disease

NCT03135873,Mastiha Treatment for Obese With NAFLD Diagnosis,"NAFLD/NASH is one of the most common complications of obesity and diabetes mellitus in Western populations affecting approximately 50% of diabetics and 76% of obese patients. Due to the lack of specialized treatment, many new efforts focus on exploring alternative, non-pharmacologic means for managing the disease, including bioactive substances in fruits, vegetables and plants or their products. Mastiha, a natural product of Greece, consists of a great variety of bioactive phytochemical compounds and demonstrates antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial and lipid lowering properties. Taking into account the contribution of oxidative stress and inflammation to NAFLD/NASH pathogenesis, the hypothesis that Mastiha could improve disease aspects is investigated. Thus, design of a multicenter (4 centers across Europe), randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled (parallel arm) clinical trial to assess the effect of Mastiha on clinical course of NAFLD/NASH patients has been conducted. The effectiveness of the proposed intervention will be evaluated via clinical and laboratory markers. MAST4HEALTH aims also at exploring gene-diet interactions and at correlating genetic and epigenetic markers with metabolomic and intestinal microbiota profiles pre- and post- intervention. To this end, patients with confirmed NAFLD/NASH will be allocated to either verum or placebo group. Duration of the intervention will be 6 months and the dosage applied will be 2.1 g daily. NAFLD/NASH diagnosis will be confirmed by MS scanning and the sensitive LiverMultiScan technique. Anthropometric, demographic data, body composition, dietary habits, physical activity, family history and smoking status will be assessed pre- and post- intervention. Biochemical profile, oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as epigenetic and metabolomic profiles will be assessed in blood samples, while the metagenome profile will be examined in stools. Both groups will receive counselling to allow for body weight regulation up to 5%. Compliance will be assessed monthly and side effects will be reported.",Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease

NCT05334173,Gastric Bypass With Different Lengths of the Bilipancreatic Limb,"Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) has been the most performed bariatric surgical intervention until a few years ago, due to its good results in terms of weight loss and remission of comorbidities such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. However, more than 25% of patients do not obtain the expected result.There is no uniform technique to perform a LRYGB, but traditionally it was constructed using a long alimentary limb (AL) and a short biliopancreatic limb (BPL). There is no current consensus on the ideal length of the LRYGB limbs.The distal gastric bypass at the expense of a longer biliopancreatic limb (LBPL-GB) could induce more excess of weight loss (EWL%), but with possible protein malnutrition depending on the length of the remaining common limb.The aim of this study is compare a LBPL-GB (BPL 150cm, AL 70cm) with LAL-GB (BPL 70cm, AL 150cm).PRIMARY OUTCOME: to evaluate if there are differences in weight loss. SECONDARY OUTCOME: to assess whether there are differences in both groups in remission of the most common comorbidities and in quality of life.DESIGN: multicenter, prospective, randomized study in blocks (1:1), blinded for the patient and to the surgeon up to the time of intervention, in patients with indication of RYGB for obesity (BMI\>35 with associated comorbidity or BMI\>40 with or without comorbidity, excluding those of BMI\>50). Intervention: LRYGB type 1 (LAL-GB: 150cm ALand 70cm BPL) or type 2 (LBPL-GB: 70cm AL and 150cm BPL).The expected result is that the patients with LBPL-GB present better EWL%, and higher remission of their comorbidities than the comparison group","Laparoscopic-Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass|Obesity|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2|Hypertension|Dyslipidemias|Sleep Apnea"

NCT03575273,The Impact of Methadone Maintenance Therapy on Food Reward Processing in Opioid Dependence,"Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) has shown clear efficacy for relieving opioid withdrawal symptoms and reducing the morbidity and mortality of opioid dependence. A notable phenomenon associated with MMT is increased food intake, enhanced sweet preferences, and weight gain. The underlying neural mechanisms for opioid-related overconsumption are not well understood but are thought to arise from role in 1) increasing the palatability and hedonic aspects of food and 2) diminishing satiety signaling systems. In the proposed project, the investigators will examine methadone's potential role in opioid-related overconsumption of food. The investigators propose to examine eating behavior, sucrose preferences, and an event-related potential (ERP) component that is induced by appetitive motivation for highly rewarding foods in patients with a history of opioid dependence receiving methadone maintenance therapy (O+MMT) and not receiving opioid agonist therapy (O-MMT). A matched sample of obese and overweight adults without history of opioid use (HOC) will also be examined.",Opioid Dependence|Obesity

NCT01865227,"Obesity Surgery, Counseling, and Psychological Well-Being","Obesity has become a global epidemic causing enormous human and economic costs. Incidence rates have doubled over the last few decades and obesity-related illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases now constitute one of the major contributors to the global burden of disability. Overall, obesity has been recognized as one of the most pressing public health concerns worldwide and effective treatment and prevention strategies are urgently required. While behavioral and pharmacological treatments (e.g.low calorie diets, medication) are successful means for overcoming overweight and mild obesity, more severe cases of obesity usually fail to respond to such interventions. As a result, the demand for weight loss surgery is growing among this population. However, uncertainties about the effectiveness of obesity surgery persist and high relapse rates (i.e. weight regain) are common. Further research in this field is needed to identify risk factors that may trigger relapse and to understand patients' treatment needs in greater depth. Previous studies have pointed toward high levels of mental health problems among patients. However, the impact of preoperative psychopathology on actual surgery outcomes remains unclear. Similarly, few studies have investigated the effect of postoperative therapy on patients' psychological functioning and weight loss patterns. Research addressing these gaps is imperative to establish best-practice approaches. This challenge applies in particular to Middle East and North Africa(MENA) countries where research in the field of bariatric surgery and related mental health is largely missing. This is a major concern given the fact that the MENA region experienced the highest increase in overweight and obesity in recent decades compared to other countries.The proposed study aims to address this deficiency by examining obesity surgery patients in two Arab countries (UAE and Jordan). The goals of the project are to investigate the nature and extent of psychological health concerns among these patients before and after surgery and potential associations with treatment outcomes. Moreover, it will test the efficacy of post-operative counseling to improve weight loss and psychological health. For this purpose, a randomized clinical trial design will be employed so that cause and effect relationships between postoperative counseling and treatment outcomes(i.e. weight loss and psychological functioning) can be examined experimentally. The study will start by assessing participants' psychological health prior to surgery by using standardized self-report measures.After surgery, participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention condition consisting of 3-monthly post-operative medical checkups plus group counseling or the treatment as usual condition (i.e. 3-monthly standard medical checkups only). Additionally, participants' psychological health will be reassessed in both groups at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery. The benefit of the experimental study design is that it allows comparing patient outcomes between groups while at the same time controlling for a wide range of potential confounding variables.The data collected are expected to make a significant contribution to the treatment challenge of one of the most pressing public health concerns worldwide. Study results will add to clinical practice by broadening and deepening our knowledge of the treatment needs of obese patients. By identifying psychological health concerns that may threaten successful treatment outcomes high-risk patient groups can be recognized early, which in turn may help to reduce postoperative weight regain and other complications.To the best of the PI's knowledge, the proposed work would be the first study of this kind in the Arab world. Findings will be helpful for developing culturally sensitive and evidence-based best-practice guidelines, which are vital to achieve satisfying long-term outcomes. Moreover, study results will be relevant for research communities and practitioners outside the MENA region since empirical support for the effectiveness of obesity surgery remains weak internationally.",Obesity|Bariatric Surgery

NCT00342927,Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (F.I.N.D.),"The Family Investigation of Nephropathy and Diabetes (FIND) is a multicenter study designed to identify genetic determinants of diabetic kidney disease. FIND will be conducted in eleven centers and in many ethnic groups throughout the United States. Two different strategies will be used to localize genes predisposing to kidney disease: a family-based genetic linkage study and a case-control study that utilizes admixture linkage disequilibrium. The center based at the Phoenix office of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK-Phoenix) will conduct family-based linkage studies among American Indian populations in the southwestern United States.Participants (index cases) with diabetes and kidney disease will initially be recruited, and their parents and siblings will also be invited to participate. Genetic material from these participants will be used to genotype markers throughout the genome. Linkage analysis will be conducted to identify particular chromosomal regions containing genes that influence susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease. Linkage analyses will also be used to identify genes influencing traits related to diabetic kidney disease, such as serum creatinine, urinary protein excretion, plasma glucose levels, blood pressure and blood lipid levels. Regions that show evidence for linkage will then be examined in more detail, with both genetic linkage and association studies, to attempt to identify the specific genes that influence diabetic kidney disease, or related traits.The identification of genes that influence susceptibility to diabetic kidney disease will lead to a better understanding of how kidney disease develops. In the long run, this may lead to improved treatment and prevention of diabetic kidney disease.",Diabetic Nephropathy|Diabetes Mellitus|Diabetic Kidney Disease|Albuminuria

NCT01178476,Prevention of Severe Hypoglycaemia With Hypo-Safe Hypoglycaemia Alarm Device,"Hypoglycaemia is the most common acute complication in insulin-treated diabetes. The fear of hypoglycaemia discourages diabetic subjects from the attempt to maintain tight glycemic control, which in turn leads to increased diabetes related morbidity and mortality.Neuroglycopenic hypoglycaemia in insulin-treated diabetic patients is associated with characteristic changes in EEG with a decrease in alpha activity and an increase in delta and theta activity. We have recently demonstrated that hypoglycaemia-associated EEG-changes can be recorded from subcutaneously placed electrodes using an automated mathematical algorithm based on non-linear spectral analysis. Experimental findings hold promises that an alarm, given at the time of EEG-changes, can help the patients to avoid severe hypoglycaemia by ingestion of carbohydrate.This is the first larger scale trial testing the clinical applicability of a hypoglycaemia-alarm based on real-time analysis of EEG-signals.",Type 1 Diabetes
NCT05024227,The Effect of Nursing Education Intervention on Women's Health Literacy of Plasticizers,"Environmental hormone (environmental hormone), also known as ""endocrine disrupting chemicals"" (EDCS), is a pollutant that affects the endocrine system and causes diseases and dysfunction throughout the life cycle. Many daily products are ubiquitous, and the most common are phthalates (plasticizers); in recent years, many scientific research reports have determined the adverse health effects of phthalates, including: Infertility (Den Hond et al. al., 2015), testicular hypoplasia (Fisher, 2004), obesity (Dirtu et al., 2013), diabetes (Fénichel \& Chevalier, 2017), hyperglycemia (Williams et al., 2016), asthma (Wang et al., 2016) al., 2015), endometriosis and high abortion rate (Roy et al., 2015), polycystic ovary syndrome (Vagi et al., 2014), prostate cancer (Chuang et al., 2020), and Breast cancer (Chen et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2017; Holmes et al., 2014; López-Carrillo et al., 2010), etc. In 2011, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration detected di（2-ethylhexyl）phthalate (DEHP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) in foods, food supplements, and beverages, and determined that the Taiwanese population has a high content of phthalates (Yang et al., 2013). It pointed out that exposure to plasticizers in the uterus will have lifelong effects and even endanger the health of the next generation, indicating that there is a significant positive correlation between the concentration of metabolites in the urine of pregnant women and the urine of their children (Lin et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2013), even related to children's autism (Carter \& Blizard, 2016; Rossignol et al., 2014).However, so far there is still a lack of research on environmental hormone-plasticizers to improve health literacy or develop interventional research. Therefore, this study hopes to track the health literacy of their plasticizers and provide nursing education interventions (including e-health platform assistance) for women. Randomized controlled trials (English: randomized controlled trial, RCT) will be used to test nursing education interventions using a double-blind trial system.

NCT03956927,Feasibility of Simulation in Therapeutic Patient Education for Adult Diabetic Patients Using the Freestyle Libre® Device,"The benefits of Therapeutic Patient Education (TPE) have long been proven, but its implementation remains insufficient. It is only accessible to a part of the population and is too often limited to the acquisition of knowledge. TPE consists of supporting the patient in making decisions about his or her health, managing his or her life with the disease and treatment through the acquisition or maintenance of skills.Simulation is a pedagogical method of creating fictional or reconstructed environments in order to develop skills, know-how and abilities for which direct instruction is impossible for ethical, economic or technical reasons. To date, it is recommended for the development of caregiver skills, and has been the subject of two studies among family caregivers. It seems likely that simulation will add value to the methods currently used in TPE.To our knowledge, no studies have been conducted on simulation-based TPE (S-TPE) with patients.A consensus conference, which is a rigorous method of comparing the opinions of experts in TPE, simulation, patient experts and caregivers, was held in order to determine the learning that could be developed through simulation and the conditions of use. However, since the patient is a specific type of learner, we hypothesize that there may be some additional conditions for the use of S-TPE. And the value of this approach remains to be demonstrated. Since the use of S-TPE has never been studied with patients, a feasibility test would make it possible to evaluate, in the context of care, the possibility of its use and its acceptance by both patients and caregivers. This is necessary before considering a multicenter trial that demonstrates an interest in developing patient skills. It was decided to carry out this study in patients with diabetes, a condition for which TPE is a precursor. Caregivers will be able to objectify the advantages and limitations of using S-TPE.",Insulin-Dependent Diabetes
NCT03446573,Switch Study to Evaluate Dolutegravir Plus Lamivudine in Virologically Suppressed Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 Positive Adults (TANGO),"The aim of the study is to establish if human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected adult participants with current virologic suppression on a \>=3-drug tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based regimen (TBR) remain suppressed upon switching to a two-drug regimen of dolutegravir (DTG) 50 milligram (mg) + lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg. This study will also provide important information regarding the safety and participant satisfaction with this two-drug regimen. The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate the non-inferior antiviral activity of switching to DTG + 3TC once daily compared to continuation of TBR over 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced, virologically suppressed participants. This study also will characterize the long-term antiviral activity, tolerability and safety of DTG + 3TC compared to TBR through Week 144 and characterize the long-term antiviral activity, tolerability and safety of DTG + 3TC through Week 200.This will be a 200-week, Phase III, randomized, open-label, active-controlled, multicenter, parallel- group study.

NCT02948673,The Production of Reactive Oxygen Species in Response to Glutathione Supplementation and Acute Exercise,"Objectives: The research focus of the study is the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in response to glutathione (GSH) supplementation and in response to acute exercise.Oxidative stress is suggested as a possible causative factor in the pathophysiology of skeletal muscle insulin resistance. GSH is the most abundant endogenous antioxidant in the cell and thus, a crucial protector against oxidative stress and insulin resistance. It has been found that patients with T2D have a decreased level of GSH in plasma and that 1 h GSH infusion improves skeletal muscle glucose uptake by \~25% and the redox environment in patients with T2D. Therefore, we want to investigate the effect of 3 months of GSH supplementation on skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial ROS production in patients with T2D and healthy controls.Hypothesis: Oral GSH supplementation will improve skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity in patients with T2D and this effect will be linked to a reduced mitochondrial ROS production in the skeletal muscle.In contrast to the link between oxidative stress and insulin resistance, ROS produced in response to exercise is an important physiological stimulus as it is suggested to play a key role in the beneficial mitochondrial biogenesis observed in response to training. It has been reported that some patients with T2D have a diminished mitochondrial biogenesis in response to training, but the reason for this defect is not known. We want to investigate the link between exercise-stimulated ROS production and the mitochondrial biogenesis response in patients with T2D and healthy controls in response to acute exercise at two different intensities.Hypothesis: Considering the pathological condition of T2D skeletal muscle (i.e. high chronic ROS level), we speculate that a lower exercise intensity, leading to a lower exercise-stimulated ROS production is a more optimal stimulus (i.e. not to high) for mitochondrial biogenesis in patients with T2D.",Type 2 Diabetes|Oxidative Stress|Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species Production
NCT02309073,PC Protocol: Preconceptional Screening,"Background: Despite considerable progress in the field of assisted reproductive technology (ART) maximum pregnancy rates generally do not exceed 30%. Furthermore, substantial differences in pregnancy rates are seen between women starting ART from seemingly similar clinical starting points and information on pregnancy/neonatal complications after ART is limited. For physicians and patients it would be extremely valuable if tools could be developed through which individualised chances of live birth and the development of pregnancy/neonatal complications can be calculated. In addition, there is increasing knowledge about health risks associated with subfertility and in particular with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) and premature ovarian failure (POF). An important void in research to date is the absence of a control group to check important new findings.Objectives: The study protocol aims to form a cohort of normo-ovulatory women with a regular indication for ART which can aid the investigators principle lines of research:1. To study initial predictors of ovarian response to stimulation for IVF2. To study predictors of chances for live birth after repeated IVF cycles3. To assess the role for vascular health in the probabilities of success in ART treatment4. To study predictors for pregnancy and neonatal complications5. To form a control group for cycle disturbance studiesStudy design: In this part of the protocol, serum and material for DNA analysis will be collected by asking patients to have 20 ml of blood drawn during a routine blood withdrawal. This blood will be stored in the Biobank of the UMC Utrecht at -80 C.Study population: All women starting ART will be asked to participate. Women starting donorinsemination treatment will be asked to participate, from the viewpoint that they potentially will form a normal fertile control group.Nature and extent of the burden and benefits associated with participation: There are no benefits or risks for the study patient as blood is withdrawn during a routine venapuncture and results will not be used for clinical practice.",Infertility

However, this association has been established under fasting conditions, so they only give information about a metabolic state and do not reflect the dynamics and flexibility of the metabolism of these amino acids in the absence or presence of insulin resistance. The main aim of this study is to compare the catabolism of branched chain amino acids and their keto acids in subjects with and without insulin resistance, after the infusion of an amino acid solution with high concentration of the branched chain amino acids, leucine, valine, and isoleucine. The results of this project will allow the investigators to understand the dynamics of the branched chain amino acids and their derivatives, and its relationship with insulin resistance, which could eventually be used to design nutritional strategies to treat insulin resistance and thus, delay the development of type 2 diabetes.",Obesity|Insulin Resistance

NCT03308773,Disease Prevention in Clinical Practice Base on Patient Specific Physiology,"It is well known that the Type 2 diabetes and vascular disease are preceded by over ten years by metabolic dysfunction and anatomic changes that can be quantified. In order to develop effective preventive strategies and reduce the cost burden to the health care system, recognition of the earliest pathophysiology of Type 2 diabetes and vascular disease is clinically relevant. The interval retrospective evaluation of data from patient records, reflect the effectiveness of the various treatments implemented in clinical practice.Prevalence of ""prediabetes"" among American adults is estimated to be \~84 million, or one out of three Americans. Over a 5-7 year period approximately one third of these prediabetic individuals will progress to type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes is a heterogenous group comprised of individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and increased A1c (5.7-6.4%). Although different pathophysiologies are present in individuals with IFG and IGT, their conversion rate to overt type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is similar.Insulin resistance is a common causal feature of many of the pathophysiologic mechanisms linking macrovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Because hyperglycemia is the major factor responsible for the development of microvascular complications, it logically follows that prevention of progression of prediabetes to overt diabetes should retard/prevent the development of the microvascular complications. From the measurement of plasma glucose, insulin, and c-peptide levels during the oral glucose tolerance test, one can derive measures of the two core defects responsible for the development of T2DM, i.e. insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction as well as the degree of dysglycemia.By combining a standard medical evaluation with the evaluation of cardiovascular biomarkers, patients at intermediate risk of vascular disease can be identified. In these patients, carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and carotid plaque evaluation is offered to attempt to clarify risk.The hypothesis of this observational study is that the characterization of the physiology and anatomy of patients at risk of developing type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease can stratify risk of developing disease and direct treatment strategies tailored to the identified physiologic defect, leading to improvements in the delay or prevention of disease.",PreDiabetes|Insulin Resistance|Type2 Diabetes|NASH - Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis|Diastolic Dysfunction|Dementia|Atrial Fibrillation|Cancer|Atherosclerosis|Carotid Plaque

NCT03230760,Acupuncture for Breast Engorgement During Lactation,"Breast engorgement which may manifest swell, throb, and cause mild to extreme pain is the common difficulty for breast feeding woman. It occurs in the mammary glands due to expansion and pressure exerted by the synthesis and storage of breast milk and it usually happens when the breasts switch from colostrums to mature milk. However, engorgement can also happen if lactating women miss several nursing and not enough milk is expressed from the breasts. It can be exacerbated by insufficient breastfeeding and/or blocked milk ducts. Engorgement may lead to mastitis and untreated engorgement puts pressure on the milk ducts, often causing a plugged duct.According the meridian theory, the investigators propose the acupuncture treatment for patients of breast engorgement.The investigators will include 60 patients and measure the acupuncture effect. The inclusion criteria are women with breast engorgement and 20 years old or older. Exclusion standards are patients with: 1. diabetes mellitus 2. Psychological disease or mental illness 3.

NCT06258473,Addressing Gaps in the Hypertension and Diabetes Care Continuum in Rural Bangladesh: The Dinajpur Study,"In the present implementation study, we aim to document the experience of implementing integrated, decentralized primary care in rural Bangladesh, including components of healthcare provider training, mHealth, decentralization with task shifting, and community-based care, and to generate data on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the multicomponent integrated care as compared to usual care and to mHealth intervention alone. We will also Investigate the factors that explain how the interventions influence hypertension and diabetes management and explore barriers/facilitators to delivering and sustaining intervention. We will conduct mixed-methods research to understand how the intervention influences treatment and prevention in this patient population. Particularly, we will assess lifestyle changes (i.e., smoking, dietary salt intake, physical activity, alcohol consumption), and burden for patients (e.g., waiting time, travel-related cost) at individual and community level. Qualitative data will shed light on facilitators and barriers to hypertension and diabetes prevention and control from the perspectives of patients (and their families), primary care providers, public health officials, and other stakeholders. Additionally, we will undertake a health economic evaluation of the interventions for primary care systems. A comprehensive evaluation of cost and effectiveness will be important for the models tested, providing necessary evidence for policymakers and stakeholders to scale up the interventions. We hypothesize that compared with usual care, the multicomponent decentralized primary care will improve all steps along hypertension and diabetes care continuum. On the other hand, we hypothesize that the mHealth intervention alone (Simple App) may improve BP and glycemic control compared with usual care but will have a limited impact on rates of screening, diagnosis, and treatment. We also hypothesize that the multicomponent integrated care will lead to a higher treatment success rate relative to mHealth intervention alone.",Hypertension|Diabetes

NCT01876173,Feasibility Testing of Decision Support for Patients Who Are Candidates for an Implantable Defibrillator,"Sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to a ventricular arrhythmia is a serious cause of cardiovascular death in Canada. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) offers high-risk patients a treatment option to reduce the incidence of SCD by delivering an internal shock to restore a normal rhythm, if needed. Definitive evidence has established the effectiveness of the ICD for reducing mortality when used as prophylaxis for SCD (a primary prevention indication). Approximately 3,700 new candidates accrue annually. Practice guidelines define the criteria to determine patient ICD candidacy for primary prevention. However, in addition to SCD risk, ICD candidates may have chronic diseases such as diabetes, renal insufficiency, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. Thus, balancing the benefits and risks of an ICD can become complex, particularly when competing mortality risks are present. Research has recognized human costs associated with device complications and shocks affecting psychological, health related quality of life (HRQL), and morbidity outcomes. The complexities surrounding the long-term benefits/risks, complications, replacements, and shocks, warrant decision support to prepare patients to make decisions. In Canada, there is no clear framework to support patients' decision-making in the context of ICD treatment options. Decision support, using a decision aid, could moderate treatment related uncertainty and prepare patients to make active, informed, quality decisions.Objectives: 1) develop a decision aid for ICD candidates to support quality decision-making (informed, deliberate, values-based choices), 2) to evaluate the decision aid, and 3) to determine the feasibility of conducting a trial.",Cardiovascular Disease|Sudden Cardiac Death

These ulcers, or sores, if left untreated can increase the chance of amputation. Part of the treatment is to have the person wear a diabetic shoe or boot to help their foot heal. Sometimes people don't wear the boot like they are told. The investigators want to compare three different kinds of diabetic boots to see if they can help make it easier for people to wear their boots as instructed.The investigators will look at three groups of participants: the first group will wear a boot that can't be taken off. The second group will wear a boot that can be taken off, and they will get counseling about how important it is to follow instructions as to how often and when to wear the boot. The third group will wear a ""smart"" boot, which will interact with the person through a smart watch and smart phone, and give them direct feedback about how they are doing with following their boot wearing prescription.The investigators will also be looking at how much physical activity, like walking, the participants do. And they will compare how well participants sleep and rate their quality of life in the three different boots. The investigators think that giving participants information about how much they are wearing their boot using readily available technology will help them to follow the doctor's directions better, and help their wounds heal faster.",Diabetic Foot Ulcer
NCT04132531,Effect of Weight Loss Surgery on Stem Cells.,"Obesity and diabetes are linked to increased risk for health problems such as heart attack, stroke, and death. At the cellular level, obesity and diabetes increase levels of harmful inflammatory cells (M1 macrophages) and decreases levels of protective stem cells (circulating progenitor cells) in the blood.Bariatric (weight loss) surgery is an effective treatment that leads to significant weight loss and improved health in patients with obesity. However, it is unknown if weight loss surgery also replenishes healthy stem cells and decreases inflammatory cells in the body. Therefore, the purpose of this research study is to compare levels of these stem and inflammatory cells before and after bariatric surgery, and to compare to a control group of healthy normal weight participants.The investigators anticipate that inflammatory cell levels will be reduced and stem cell levels and function will be restored after bariatric surgery, similar to levels of healthy normal weight individuals.","Obesity, Morbid|Stem Cells|Cardiovascular Morbidity"
