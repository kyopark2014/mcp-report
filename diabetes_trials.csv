NCT06313892,The Effect of Home Based Tel-Exercise on Dialysis Patients,"The objective of the trial is to assess key areas of uncertainty regarding the use of synchronous home-based tele exercise in future practice and research, including issues relating to feasibility, safety and potential for efficacy.",End Stage Renal Disease|Hemodialysis Complication
NCT01398592,Vildagliptin Versus Sitagliptin - Differences in Fasting Plasma Glucose Lowering Efficacy,"This study is designed to assess the potential difference in Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) lowering efficacy between the two DPP-4 inhibitors vildagliptin and sitagliptin, both after a two weeks treatment on top of metformin.",Diabetes Mellitus Type 2
NCT01913392,"Effect of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy in the Morbidly Obese, Kidney Transplant Candidate",A prospective clinical trial will study the effects of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in the potential renal transplant candidate who is denied acceptance due mainly to the morbid obesity.,"Obesity, Morbid|Transplant; Failure, Kidney"
NCT04459689,COVID-19 in PID Survey,"With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to understand the impact of infection on immunodeficient individuals. Whilst co-morbidities (such as diabetes, cancer, arterial hypertension, heart disease...) have been documented in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no information on the consequences and outcomes for individuals with primary immunodeficiencies (PID).Following the 1st phase of the survey (launched by Isabelle Meyts (ESID), Nizar Mahlaoui (CEREDIH \& IPOPI) and Kate Sullivan with Stuart Tangye (IUIS), that gave an idea of the number of affected PID patients and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 and directly focusing on obtaining this top level of information), we are launching the 2nd phase: ""COPID19"".COPID19 survey is a secured online GDPR compliant platform based in Paris (Imagine Institute). It has been approved by the Paris-Necker-Enfants malades IRB and Ethics Committee. However, this retrospective survey is designed for global distribution. Data can be entered by a health care professional (mostly clinicians) through a personal login and password.Each documenting person will have access to his/her own patients' data. COPID19 require a greater level of information than the 1st phase. The eCRF will be open to evolutions depending on progresses in our knowledge of this pandemic.",Primary Immune Deficiency|COVID
NCT03699189,"ANAIS, a Spanish Version of the DAFNE Programme","ANAIS is a therapeutic education programme for type 1 diabetes based on a flexible insulin regime adjusted to the patient's food intake. Participants are randomised in two groups, to attend the training course immediately (immediate ANAIS) or a year later (delayed ANAIS). The main outcome was HbA1c at one year.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1"
NCT03484689,MBCT for DM Distress: a Pilot Qusai-experimental Study,"Background: Diabetes-related distress (DRD) is very common among people with type II diabetes mellitus (DM). DRD led to poorer DM control and may led to adverse prognosis. Yet, there is no widely accepted or recommended DRD treatment.Mindfulness was shown to relieve psychological distress in various physical and mental conditions.Aim: as a pilot project, we aim to determine if mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), which is one of the widely used mindfulness program, is feasible and acceptable and may improve DRD in our Chinese population.Method: 20 Chinese participants with suboptimally controlled DM and high DRD will be recruited to a 8- week MBCT group. Pre-group and post-group (immediate and 2-month post-group) data including DRD score, quality-of life measures will be compared.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"
NCT04216589,"Study of Semaglutide for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), a Metabolic Syndrome With Insulin Resistance, Increased Hepatic Lipids, and Increased Cardiovascular Disease Risk (The SLIM LIVER Study)","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of semaglutide on intra-hepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content in people living with HIV (PLWH), central adiposity, insulin resistance or pre-diabetes, and hepatic steatosis.",HIV Infections|Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
NCT03259789,Safety and Efficacy of Bexagliflozin Compared to Placebo as Add-on Therapy to Metformin in Type 2 Diabetes Subjects,The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of bexagliflozin compared to placebo as an add-on therapy to metformin in lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).,Type2 Diabetes Mellitus
NCT06326489,Evaluating the Efficacy and Quality of Life Impact of Transitioning to Advanced Hybrid Closed-Loop Insulin Pump Therapy in Romanian Children With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,"The proposed study aims to demonstrate the potential benefits of transitioning T1DM children from predictive low glucose suspend insulin pump therapy to advanced hybrid closed-loop insulin pump therapy in Romania. Primary Outcome: Variations in HbA1c between baseline visit (V1 - 740G) and assessment visit following three months of 780G insulin pump therapy (V2 - 780G).Secondary Outcomes: changes in insulin requirements, time in range (TIR) levels, time below range (TBR), coefficient of variation (CV), frequency of severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events requiring hospitalization, and PedsQL SF15 questionnaire scores.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1"
NCT00572689,Pilot Study of Exenatide Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in Gestational Diabetes,"This study is being done to study how exenatide, an FDA-approved drug that lowers blood sugar in non-pregnant patients with type II diabetes, works in pregnant women. To do this, we will study the drug's pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug; specifically, how quickly your body breaks down and excretes exenatide) and pharmacodynamics (what the drug does to the body; specifically, how effectively exenatide helps your pancreas secrete insulin and how well it controls blood sugar after a meal). There are only two main drug therapies (insulin injections and glyburide pills) currently used for gestational diabetes and not all women achieve good enough blood sugar control without side effects. Therefore, we hope to find out if exenatide might also be helpful in gestational diabetes.",Gestational Diabetes
