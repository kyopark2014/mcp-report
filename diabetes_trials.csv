NCT03678831,"Characteristics of Marrow Fatty Cells in the Ageing of Bone and Joints, Osteoarthritis and Osteoporosis","Obesity and other associated complications promote the development and the progression of osteoarthritis. The subcutaneous and abdominal fat release several factors that alter bone and the cartilage. The role of the marrow fat in close connection with bone has not been defined yet, whereas cellular and animal models indicate that this fat depot modifies bone and cartilage.The aim of the study is to define if the marrow fat produces more joint-altering factors by comparison with subcutaneous fat. This fat depot can be characterized from removed pieces during the prosthetic surgery of the knee. Measuring before surgery the body weight, waist and hip circumferences, blood pressure, glucose, insulin and lipids in blood will also allow to determine if obesity and/or type 2 diabetes make this fat more dangerous for the joint. Such research will allow the elaboration of new therapeutic strategies in osteoarthritis.","Osteoarthritis, Knee|Prosthesis User"

NCT00356265,Alpha-Adrenoceptor Vascular Function In Chronic Kidney Disease Focus On The Role Of Endothelial Nitric Oxide,"The purpose of this study is to learn more about why most patients with early stages of kidney disease have high blood pressure.We know the body produces natural substances that cause blood vessels to open wider to carry more blood when needed. An example is during exercise. Other natural substances cause blood vessels to get smaller and slow down blood flow when needed. An example is when people are cold. The balance between these substances is important. People with kidney disease and high blood pressure do not have the normal balance of these substances.This study will include 3 groups of people, people with normal blood pressure, people with high blood pressure and people with kidney disease.* Subjects will have a screening physical examination, including an ECG and laboratory tests* Subjects with high blood pressure may not take their regular blood pressure medication for 3 weeks prior to the inpatient GCRC study* Subjects will be given intra-arterial medications that will cause changes in the blood vessels during the in-patient study.The study will then compare the responses of the three groups. A GFR test will be done to confirm the renal function of the group with chronic kidney disease.These studies will provide insight into the mechanisms of the pathogenesis of enhanced α1 vasoreactivity in subjects with progressive renal disease.

NCT02691065,Protease Inhibitor Vs. Raltegravir-based ART and Inflammation in HIV Infection,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection damages body defence mainly by affecting two important white blood cells called cluster of differentiation (CD4) T cells and monocytes. This immune dysfunction leads to persistent inflammation, which is partially resolved with long-term anti-HIV therapy. Importantly, such inflammation increases risk for cardiovascular, diabetes, and kidney diseases. The causes of this inflammation are largely unknown and include HIV itself, presence of other infections, lifestyle characteristics like increased cholesterol levels, obesity, smoking and alcohol abuse. In addition, inflammation can be driven by certain type of anti-HIV therapy called protease inhibitor (PI). PI has been associated with an increase of cholesterol and may contribute to inflammation. A new class of medication that is now available in Canada called integrase inhibitor (II) may have a lesser or no effect on cholesterol levels. Therefore, it is important to study the effect of II on cholesterol levels and inflammation.The purpose of this study is to assess the inflammatory changes, in the blood of persons treated with PI that will switch to the II or may remain on their PI-containing regimen. By comparing persons continuing their current PI-based regimen with those who switch to II-based regimen, we will know if the change from PI to raltegravir (Isentress), a type of II, decreases lipids and inflammatory markers.The adult persons living with HIV, who are on PI-based therapy for more than a year, with any CD4 T cell count and plasma viral load below level of detection, will be invited to participate in the study. 40 study participants will be selected by randomization (like a toss of a coin) to either continue PI-based regimen (20 participants) or switch to raltegravir-based regimen (20 participants) for a period of 12 months. Blood samples of the study participants will be drawn before, during and at the end of study to evaluate changes in markers of inflammation, cholesterol level and CD4 T cell and monocyte function. No experimental anti-HIV medication will be used; change of therapy will include raltegravir which is one of currently recommended medications to treat HIV in Canada.This study will be able to answer this important question whether inflammation can be decreased by switching therapy from PI-based therapy to raltegravir-based therapy. Ultimately, information provided by this study will contribute to the health of persons living with HIV.",HIV
NCT00911482,Production of Free Fatty Acids From Blood Triglycerides,"The overall hypothesis of these studies is that circulating triglycerides, coming primarily from fat in the diet, are an important source of free fatty acids. Free fatty acids are the major fat fuel in the body, and when they are elevated in the blood they are thought to raise the risk of cardiovascular disease by causing insulin resistance (in some cases leading to diabetes), raising blood pressure, and other effects. The investigator will use sophisticated methods for tracing triglycerides and free fatty acids in the blood. These methods involve the administration of low doses of radioactive and stable isotopes of naturally occurring fats. The studies will determine the contribution of triglycerides to free fatty acids in normal people and also in people with diabetes.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2|Insulin Resistance|Dyslipidemias"

NCT05012020,Feasibility Study of a mHealth Platform for Remote Patient Monitoring of CKD and Peritoneal Dialysis Patients,"The best treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is facilitated by early detection, when the progression of the disease can be slowed down or stopped. Early treatment focuses on diet, exercise, lifestyle changes, treating risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) and administration of medications supporting kidney functions. However, once the glomerular filtration rate dropped below 15 ml/min/1.73m2, treatment with dialysis or a kidney transplant is required. Dialysis treatments come with a huge lifestyle management and economic burden to the patients as well as the healthcare systems.The challenges may be facilitated by usage of mobile applications that help the patients/caregivers and multidisciplinary team to manage the complexity of Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) treatment. Even though several mobile applications currently exist, they focus on certain limited aspects of health monitoring like diet or vitals and medical adherence like medication reminders. An application which would take a comprehensive all-in-one solution approach targeted towards managing kidney health is needed. The platform developed by AWAK Technologies consists of a Admin Portal, web-based Clinic Portal and a Patient Mobile Application. The App would allow patients/caregivers to enter treatment data related to their dialysis therapy, medication, symptoms and vital monitoring. It also allows them to communicate with their healthcare team via messaging and teleconsult.The study aims to evaluate the feasibility of using this mHealth platform in the clinical setting. Additionally, the clinical investigation seeks to obtain data for further development of the mHealth platform that will better fulfil the needs of patients and healthcare professionals.",Chronic Kidney Diseases

NCT04698720,Contribution of Psychological Factors in the Healing of the Diabetic Foot Ulcer,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are one of the most serious complications of diabetes and can lead to amputations in 85% of cases, resulting in physical, psychological, family, social and economic consequences. Research suggests that psychological factors may play an important role in DFU healing. Relaxation and hypnosis seem to contribute to faster wound healing. More research is needed to assess the effectiveness of different types of intervention on different types of wounds, in particular chronic wounds such as DFU.This study will evaluate the efficacy of relaxation and hypnosis, both with guided imagery, in DFU healing, physiological indicators (inflammatory, metabolic, oxidative stress, angiogenic, and miRNA biomarkers) of wound healing prognosis, and QoL, in patients with diabetic foot and a chronic ulcer. This study is a Randomized Controlled Study of a Psychological Intervention that aims to evaluate the efficiency of a muscle relaxation intervention with guided imagery (experimental group - EG1) compare to a hypnosis intervention with guided imagery (experimental group - EG2) and a neutral guided imagery placebo (active control group - ACG) and a group that does not receive any psychological intervention (passive control group - PCG).This study will also examine, qualitatively, the perspectives of patients with DFU on the relaxation and hypnosis interventions, in order to check its effectiveness; as well as the perspectives of informal caregivers on this adjuvant therapys.Participants must have a diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus and Diabetic Foot; one or two chronic active ulcers at the time of assessment; and clinical levels of stress or anxiety or depression. Participants will be randomized by the four conditions - EG1, EG2, ACG and PCG - and assessed on the day of the first consultation or nursing treatment for chronic DFU (T0), two months later (T1), and six months later (T2; follow-up). Two weeks after T1, an interview will be conducted independently with patients that completed the relaxation, hypnosis, and placebo sessions, and with the informal caregivers who provided them the DFU care. The results of the present study will contribute for a better understanding of DFU progression, healing, prevention of re-ulceration and future amputations and, consequently, for the improvement of patients' quality of life.",Diabetes Mellitus|Diabetic Foot Ulcer

NCT01881074,Periodontal Treatment Response in Type II Diabetic Patients,"Diabetes mellitus affects \> 171 million people worldwide, with type II diabetes being the most prevalent, affecting 85-95% of the diabetic population. Unfortunately, despite conventional medical treatment, some diabetic patients do not seem to be able to reach desirable metabolic control. This is a double-blinded, randomized study investigating the effects of triclosan containing toothpaste (commercial name: Colgate Total) on the response to periodontal treatment in type II diabetic patients with periodontal disease. The investigators believe that using triclosan containing toothpaste during periodontal treatment will decrease the local inflammatory response and that this reduction will improve periodontal status and metabolic control.",Type II Diabetes|Periodontal Disease
NCT01722474,Assessment of Three Instruments for the Non-invasive Measurement of Arterial Stiffness.,"The ASI Non-Invasive Arterial Stiffness Screening Device (ASI Device) is an investigational device under development for the non-invasive assessment of arterial stiffness. The ASI Device is considerably smaller and more cost effective than its commercially available counterparts. As the device is readily portable, it is intended to be targeted for use in the community (or at home), as opposed to within the hospital or clinic setting only. However, as the device is still under development, it is not known whether it is capable of determining arterial stiffness with the same sensitivity and consistency as those already in commercial use. An added variable is the fact the sensor for the ASI Device is located on the fingertip.Validation is a prerequisite for obtaining Health Canada approval of devices for diagnostic purposes. The ASI Device has not been tested against other instruments capable of providing similar measurements. Therefore, a clinical trial to compare the ASI Device against similar devices is necessary. The study will compare measurements of arterial stiffness and other central haemodynamic parameters obtained with the ASI Device against similar measurements from devices that have already been approved for this purpose by Health Canada/United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",Healthy|Diabetes Type 2|Obesity|Coronary Artery Disease|Peripheral Arterial Disease
NCT03598374,Spontaneous Reproductive Outcomes After Oral Inositol Supplementation in Infertile Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Women.,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous, multifaceted and complex disorder characterized by insulin resistance (IR), hyperinsulinemia, and hyperandrogenism leading ovarian disfunction and infertility. Given the central pathogenic role of IR in the endocrine, reproductive, and metabolic disturbances of PCOS, several pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches have been proposed to counteract the hyper insulinemic IR typical of the syndrome. Two Inositol stereoisomers, Myo-Inositol (MI) and D-chiro-inositol (DCI), captured the attention of researchers for their insulin-sensitizing actions, which configure them as proper candidates for the treatment of PCOS.Very few studies reported on spontaneous clinical pregnancy rates, none were powered for this outcome, and none reported on the clinically relevant outcome of live birth. Therefore, data about clinical pregnancy rate, live birth rate, and miscarriage rate comparing inositols with placebo are limited.Conversely, about infertility and assisted reproduction techniques (ART), improvements have been reported in PCOS women who underwent fertility treatment using inositol in different forms, combinations or doses. This data, considering the different tissue-specific ratios (i.e., 100:1 in the ovary) and the different physiological roles of inositol stereoisomers, suggest that DCI supplementation alone might not be the optimal or appropriate approach for improving IVF outcomes in PCOS patients, and drawn attention to the importance of MI and DCI supplementation in a physiological ratio in order to restore normal ovary functionality. Indeed, the combination of MI and DCI, at a more physiological ratio of 40:1, was able to more quickly restore to normal the hormonal and metabolic parameters in PCOS women than MI treatment alone or DCI treatment alone, improving the endocrine profile and IR of women with PCOS.Nevertheless, regarding infertility the primary outcomes that should be considered are clinical pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate and live birth rate. Although many studies showed improved hormonal and metabolic profile and improved ovulation rate and higher quality and number of oocyte retrieved in ART in PCOS women after inositols administration, data about clinical pregnancy rate, live birth rate, and miscarriage rate are limited with several concerns regarding interpretation of the studies.","Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome|Infertility, Female"

NCT05526274,Clinical Epidemiology of NAFLD in Children and Adolescents,"Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly increasing alongside overweight and obesity, not only in adults but also in children and adolescents. It is unknown what impact the development of NAFLD in childhood may have in later life. The importance of early detection and treatment lies in its potential for progression to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver-related death, as well as its associated extrahepatic comorbidities. Vibration-Controlled Transient Elastography (VCTE) with Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP) is an effective, non-invasive and safe diagnostic method to estimate the degree of fibrosis and steatosis in the liver, but little is known about its applicability in the paediatric population. Objectives: 1) To assess the prevalence of significant liver fibrosis (LSM≥6,5kPa) using VCTE, and that of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (≥225dB/m) using CAP in children and adolescents. 2) To determine the optimal cut-off points of the CAP to achieve maximum concordance with the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) findings in the diagnosis of mild, moderate and severe NAFLD in children and adolescents. Methods: cross-sectional population-based study which will include 2.866 subjects aged ≥9 to ≤16 years. Participants will undergo: anamnesis, physical examination, blood extraction, VCTE, MRI and questionnaires on socio-demographic data, personal and family medical history and lifestyle assessment. Applicability and relevance: the study aims to establish the foundations for the use of VCTE in children and adolescents in order to achieve early diagnosis of NAFLD. Moreover, it will serve to understand in further detail the disease and to identify the risk groups of children and adolescents who may be at risk of developing it. Ultimately, this will help determine to which subgroups of the population we need to target resources for prevention and early detection of this entity, as well as possible intervention for its treatment.",Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease|Childhood Obesity
NCT05996874,A Research Study Comparing the Effect of Different Dosing Conditions on Blood Levels of Semaglutide in a New Tablet Composition in Healthy Participants,"In this study, a known medicine called 'semaglutide' will be tested in a new tablet version. The medicine will be tested in healthy men to explore the effect of different water volumes and tablet-meal delays on blood levels of semaglutide after 10 days of oral administration. Semaglutide tablets, under the brand name Rybelsus, are approved in the EU and USA for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Participants will get a daily treatment with dose 1 new oral semaglutide tablet for 5 days followed by another 5 days with a daily treatment of dose 2 new oral semaglutide tablet. Participants will get one tablet each day for 10 days. The tablet should be taken in the morning on an empty stomach with either 50 milliliter (mL) or 120mL water, after an overnight fast of at least 6 hours (no food or drinks). Water is not allowed from 2 hours before dosing. A predefined breakfast will be served either 30, 60 or 120 minutes after taking tablet, depending on the treatment received. Breakfast will need to be eaten within 30 minutes. Which treatment participants will get is decided by chance. The study will last for about 11 weeks. This will include a screening period (up to 28 days), a treatment period (10 days) and a follow-up visit (at least 5 weeks after the last dose). Participants should not take any prescription or non-prescription medicines or herbal products (including St John's wort) within 14 days prior to the screening visit and until the follow-up visit, except for routine vitamins, medicines applied on the skin and occasional use of paracetamol (a mild pain killer). No oral medication can be taken from 2 hours before and, depending on the group participants are in, until 30, 60 or 120 minutes after each dosing with semaglutide.",Healthy Participants

NCT00005665,"Ingested Interferon Alpha: Prolongation or Permanence of the ""Honeymoon"" Phase in Newly Diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus","We hypothesize that ingested human recombinant interferon-alpha (hrIFN-a) will prolong the ""honeymoon"" period and enhance B cell survival in type 1 diabetes in a phase II randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. We have demonstrated that ingested IFN-a prevents type 1 diabetes in the NOD mouse, prolongs the ""honeymoon"" period in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetics, and delays murine islet allograft rejection. The natural history of type 1 diabetes is unique for a phase frequently referred as the ""honeymoon,"" a period in which the insulin need becomes minimal and glycemic control improves. The B cell (the insulin producing cell) partially recovers. However, as with all honeymoons, they end and the patient becomes completely insulin-deficient. The general consensus of the international diabetes community is to test potential preventive therapies for type 1 diabetes in newly diagnosed patients. Prolongation of the honeymoon as the reversal of the disease is considered a positive result.In this phase II randomized, double-blind, parallel-design clinical trial we will determine whether ingested (oral) human recombinant IFN-a will prolong the ""honeymoon"" period and increase counterregulatory anti-inflammatory cytokine(s).We will determine the safety and efficacy of 30,000 units ingested hrIFN-a vs placebo in eighty patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes in a phase II trial for one year. Primary outcome measures will be a 30% increase in C-peptide levels released after Sustacal stimulation at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry. Secondary outcome will be decreasing titers of islet cell antibodies (ICA). If successful, a larger and longer phase III trial of prevention of type 1 diabetes in high risk patients will be undertaken. We will also determine if ingested hrIFN-a increases IL-4, IL-10 or IFN-a production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMNC) from patients with recent onset type 1 diabetes.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1"
