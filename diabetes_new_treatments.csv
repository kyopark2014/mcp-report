NCT06483074,Empagliflozin on Residual Kidney Function in Incident Peritoneal Dialysis Patients,"Empagliflozin, a new class of diabetes medication, has demonstrated a reduction in renal function decline among patients with chronic kidney disease, regardless of their diabetes status. However, all previous studies excluded dialysis patients. Patients starting dialysis may still produce a certain amount of urine. Importantly, patients with better preserved residual kidney function tend to have better control of blood pressure and volume status, improved nutrition status, higher quality of life and reduced mortality rate.The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety of empagliflozin in patients on peritoneal dialysis, in preparation for a future large clinical trial. Participants who newly initiate peritoneal dialysis will be randomly allocated to either empagliflozin on top of standard of care, or standard of care alone. Over a follow-up period of six months, the investigators will collect information on urine volume, blood pressure and glucose control. Safety, tolerability and drug compliance of empagliflozin will also be evaluated. If empagliflozin is found to be safe and well tolerated in patients on peritoneal dialysis, further large-scale randomized controlled trial may be conducted to evaluate its impact on residual kidney function and other relevant clinical outcomes.",End Stage Renal Disease on Dialysis|Peritoneal Dialysis Complication|Sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitor|Residual Kidney Function

NCT00473265,Bone Properties in Hypoparathyroidism: Effects of PTH,"Whereas much information is known about the properties of bone in primary hyperparathyroidism, a disorder of parathyroid hormone (PTH) excess, virtually nothing is known about the skeleton in hypoparathyroidism, a disorder in which PTH is absent. The purpose of this research project is to test the hypothesis that the skeleton in hypoparathyroidism is abnormal in its metabolic, densitometric, geometric, biomechanical and microarchitectural features. We will also test the hypothesis that the skeleton is dependent upon PTH for normal structure and function. Using non-invasive approaches as well as direct analysis of bone itself, the human hypoparathyroid skeleton will be thoroughly characterized. With each patient serving as his/her own control, we will determine how, to what extent, and in what ways the administration of PTH restores skeletal dynamics and structure to the hypoparathyroid skeleton. In this way, we will identify those structural and dynamic elements of the skeleton that are influenced by or dependent upon PTH. Methods to be utilized include dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, quantitative central and peripheral computed tomography, geometry and size quantification, histomorphometry by standard and microCT methods, finite element analysis, biochemical bone markers, quantitative back scattered electron imaging, and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. This research project will extend our knowledge of the skeletal effects of PTH to its deficient range and thus complete our understanding of PTH action on bone gained by our many years of studying PTH overexpression in primary hyperparathyroidism. This investigation may also provide insight into the means by which PTH helps to restore the skeleton when it is used to treat osteoporosis.",Hypoparathyroidism

NCT02003274,Mixed Meal Test in Type 1 Diabetes on Insulin Pump Therapy: Optimization of Artificial Pancreas,"BACKGROUND. Optimal glucose control can prevent/relent tissue damage in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Ongoing efforts aim at developing closed loop control (CLC) algorithms linking subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin delivery (CSII). Substantial improvement towards an effective artificial pancreas system is still needed, especially in the regulation of post-meal glucose. Application of metabolic control analysis (MCA) can unveil and quantify distortions in the system properties of the glucose-insulin (pump) system (GIS), by measuring the coefficients of control (CCs) of glucose. Our approach rely on previous experience with our previous pilot protocol (NCT01800734).AIM. We will outline and compare features of GIS in T1DM patients and in healthy controls during differently sized breakfast meals and during 24-hour periods. The reproducibility of our approach will also be assessed.METHODOLOGY. Three protocols will be carried out. All T1DM patients will be on CGM/CSII therapy. In all three protocols, study 1 will be an euglycemic insulin clamp in T1DM patients and a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) in healthy controls.* Protocol 1: 10 T1DM patients on CGM/CSII and 10 control subjects will ingest a mixed meal of different size (320 and 640 kcal) on two separate occasions.* Protocol 2: 5 T1DM patients will ingest two repeat 320 kcal meals, whereas other 5 T1DM patients will ingest two 640 kcal meals on two separate occasions.* Protocol 3: 10 T1DM patients and 10 controls will be monitored for 24 hours, during which they will ingest 3 mixed meals.Substrate (including CGM)/hormone responses will be measured in all studies. Comprehensive single meal and 24-hour models of GIS will be built, MCA will be applied and the CCs of glucose assessed, thereby allowing to outline and to compare the CCs of glucose between patients and controls.EXPECTED RESULTS. Our data will be of use in devising novel clinical strategies in T1DM, including, but not limited to, development and refinement of CLC algorithms along the path towards an effective artificial pancreas system.",Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus
NCT00731874,Thymoglobulin Induction Therapy With Minimal Immunosuppression and Evaluation of Allograft Status,"Tacrolimus (Prograf) is a medication that is commonly used in patients who receive a kidney transplant. It is considered to be one of the most important medications that prevent rejection of the transplant kidney by suppressing the immune system. Although tacrolimus is good at preventing rejection, it does have some unwanted side effects. These side effects include high blood pressure, increase in blood sugar, headache, and tremor. In addition, tacrolimus causes some damage to the transplant kidney over time, by causing healthy tissue to turn into scar tissue that does not function as well as healthy tissue. Therefore, kidney function may be reduced over time. In the first three months after kidney transplant, Prograf levels are kept between 8 to 10 ng/mL. This study will compare two groups of patients that will both have their tacrolimus dose reduced slowly over three months to prevent rejection while decreasing the risk of causing toxic effects to the kidney. One group will have their Prograf levels kept between 6 and 8 ng/mL, while the second group will have their levels kept between 3 and 5 ng/mL. We will then compare the two groups to see if there are any differences in their kidney function over time.",Immunosuppression
NCT05486065,A Research Study to Look Into How Well Semaglutide Medicine Works at Different Doses in People With Type 2 Diabetes and Overweight,"This study compares how three doses of semaglutide work in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and overweight who are taking metformin. The study will look mainly at how well participant's blood sugar and participant's body weight are controlled when they are taking the study medicine at different doses. Participants will either get semaglutide \[2 milligrams (mg), 8 mg, or 16 mg\] or semaglutide placebo (a dummy medicine). Participants will take the study medicine with an injection pen called NovoPen®4. The injection pen is a medical tool with a needle used to inject the study medicine under the skin. The study will last for about 52 weeks. Participants will have 13 clinic visits and 4 phone calls.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"

NCT06490874,Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) Substudy of the DECIDE RCT,"This is a nested multicenter prospective cohort conducted concurrently and in conjunction with the DECIDE two-arm, pragmatic non-inferiority comparative effectiveness Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) (NCT06445946) of metformin versus insulin among individuals with Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) requiring pharmacotherapy for glycemic control. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)-derived glycemic metric in pregnancy and postpartum will be compared between individuals randomized to metformin versus insulin. In addition, the association between CGM metrics and adverse pregnancy outcomes will be examined. Finally, whether CGM metrics can accurately identify diabetes postpartum compared with an oral glucose tolerance test and hemoglobin A1c will be determined. A total of 300 (150 metformin, 150 insulin) pregnant individuals will be recruited with GDM who require pharmacotherapy to use a blinded CGM device (Dexcom, Inc, San Diego, CA) at two pregnancy (medication randomization, late third trimester) and three postpartum timepoints (delivery, \~6 weeks, and \~2 years).","Gestational Diabetes Mellitus|Pregnancy, High Risk"
NCT06767774,Comparison of Pitavastatin Plus Ezetimibe Versus High-Intensity Statin Therapy on Risk of New-Onset Diabetes Mellitus,"The AVOID-DM trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study comparing the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) between two cholesterol-lowering strategies in patients with prediabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The study evaluates pitavastatin plus ezetimibe combination therapy versus high-intensity statin monotherapy (rosuvastatin 20 mg). Enrolling 2,000 non-diabetic participants with ASCVD, subjects are randomized 1:1 into the two treatment arms. The primary outcome is the incidence of new-onset DM over a follow-up period of up to 36 months. Secondary outcomes include cardiovascular events, changes in LDL cholesterol, fasting glucose, HbA1c, and insulin resistance. This trial hypothesizes that the combination therapy will achieve LDL targets with a lower risk of new-onset DM compared to high-intensity statin monotherapy.",ASCVD|Diabetes|Statin
