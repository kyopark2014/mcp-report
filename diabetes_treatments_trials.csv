NCT05214573,Second-line Therapies for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Moderate Cardiovascular Disease Risk,"We will use the target trial framework for causal inference to conduct this observational retrospective cohort study that uses claims data of adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) included in the de-identified datasets of OptumLabs Data Warehouse (OLDW) and Medicare fee-for-service.In Aim 1, we will emulate a target trial comparing the effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), and sulfonylureas (SU) in adults with T2D at moderate risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with regard to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), expanded MACE, microvascular complications, severe hypoglycemia, and other adverse events.In Aim 2, we will compare these four drug classes in the same population of adults with T2D included in OLDW and Medicare fee-for-service data with respect to a set of composite outcomes identified by a group of patients with T2D as being most important to them. Specifically, in Aim 2A, we will prospectively elicit patient preferences toward various treatment outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, kidney disease) using a participatory ranking exercise, then use these rankings to generate individually weighted composite outcomes. Then, in Aim 2B, we will estimate patient-centered treatment effects of four different second-line T2D medications that reflect the patient's value for each outcome.In Aim 3, we will compare different medications within each of the four therapeutic classes with respect to MACE.",Type 2 Diabetes|Cardiac Disease
NCT05702931,Semaglutide Treatment for Hyperglycaemia After Renal Transplantation,"Background: Post-transplant hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in renal transplant recipients within the first two weeks after transplantation. Standard-of-care is primarily based on insulin treatment with the adherent risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Semaglutide produces an effective lowering of plasma glucose in diabetes patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and leads to a reduction in weight and the incidence of hypoglycaemia. The efficacy of semaglutide is untested in renal transplant recipients, and safety concerns remain, primarily on renal graft function.Objectives: The primary objective is to establish whether tablet semaglutide (Rybelsus) compared with placebo, both as add-on to standard-of-care, is non-inferior in regulating plasma glucose in patients with hyperglycaemia after renal transplantation. Secondary objectives aim to evaluate the effect of tablet semaglutide on renal graft function, weight, use of insulin, cardiovascular parameters and safety parameters (plasma semaglutide concentration, gastrointestinal side effects, dose of immunosuppressants).Design: An investigator-initiated, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel-group, randomised trial.Population: Patients (n = 104) with post-transplant hyperglycaemia and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \> 15 ml/min/1.73 m2.Methods: Participants diagnosed with post-transplant hyperglycaemia, 10 to 15 days post-transplant, will be randomised 1:1 to either 14 weeks of tablet semaglutide once daily or placebo both as add-on to standard glucose-lowering therapy. Participants will maintain weekly contact with the clinic during the first five weeks and at two to four weeks intervals during the remaining study period. During the trial, each patient will be monitored according to blood laboratory values with safety assessed at every visit by a nephrologist. Pre-prandial plasma glucose will be measured in the morning and evening to adjust glucose-lowering therapy after consultation with an endocrinologist. Double blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) will be performed for 10-14 days from baseline and at weeks 5, 9, and 13.Primary endpoint:- Mean sensor glucose (mmol/L) evaluated by CGMKey secondary endpoints:* Incidence of hypoglycaemia* Body weight (kg)* Creatinine (μmol/L)* Daily insulin dose (IE per day)* Plasma concentration of semaglutide (nmol/L)* Blood concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus (μg/L)",Hyperglycemia|Renal Transplant Complication Primary Non-Function|Diabetes
NCT05890131,Implementation of SGLT-2 Inhibitors in Patients With Heart Failure Through a New Digital Strategy,"The implementation of new medical therapies and guidelines, is a long and complex process that takes up to 10 years on average. This prolonged process is a global challenge and is mainly due to the complexity of cross-institutional patient care, involving primary care, out-patient clinics, nursing homes and patient associations.The main objective of this clinical trial is to determine whether a new digital strategy that employs official digital letters to inform and invite patients to evaluate their eligibility for new therapies, specifically the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor for heart failure patients, can facilitate and optimise the implementation. The aim is to increase the number of eligible patients with heart failure who start taking SGLT-2 inhibitors and reduce the time it takes to initiate treatment compared to the current process. Ultimately, this approach may improve patient outcomes.",Heart Failure
