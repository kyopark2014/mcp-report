NCT02139657,"An Open-label, Single-Arm Study to Evaluate the Safety and Rabies Virus Antibody Titers of Intramuscularly Administered Rabies Immune Globulin (Human)","This is a single-arm, open-label study of Rabies Immune Globulin (Human), Caprylate/Chromatography Purified (RIG-C), in approximately 12 healthy subjects. The purpose of this study is to characterize the rabies virus-specific antibody titer after a single intramuscular injection of 20 IU/kg RIG-C and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RIG-C.",Rabies
NCT03264157,Safety and Effectiveness of BPL HRIG With Active Rabies Vaccine in Healthy Subjects,"A prospective, randomized, blinded, parallel-group, non-inferiority, phase II/III study of the safety and effectiveness of simulated post-exposure prophylaxis with BPL HRIG with co-administration of active rabies vaccine in healthy subjects.",Healthy
NCT01930357,Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine-Serum Free Compared to Human Diploid Cell Vaccine in a Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Regimen,"The aim of the study is to document immunogenicity and safety of VRVg in a pre-exposure regimen in healthy children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years.Primary Objectives:* To demonstrate that VRVg is non-inferior to Imovax® Rabies in terms of proportion of subjects achieving a rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titer ≥ 0.5 international units (IU)/mL at D42, i.e. 14 days after the last vaccination.* To describe if at least 99% of subjects achieve an RVNA titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL at D42 with a lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of at least 97%, in the VRVg group.Secondary Objectives:* To assess the clinical safety of each vaccine after each vaccine injection when administered in a pre-exposure schedule.* To describe the immune response induced by each vaccine 14 days after the last vaccination, i.e. at D42, and 6 months after the first vaccination* To describe the geometric mean titer ratio between the two vaccine groups at D42, i.e. 14 days after the last vaccination.",Rabies

NCT04829630,Immunity Persistence After Abridged Intradermal Rabies PEP,"After exposure, rabies can be prevented in almost 100% of cases by the administration of sufficient and timely post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP is based on wound cleansing, antisepsis, administration of rabies vaccine as well as rabies immunoglobulin, if reviewed. However, anti-rabies PEP remains too often out of financial and / or geographic access, especially for poor and / or rural populations in endemic countries who remain the most exposed to the risk of contracting rabies. Two major studies planned in Cambodia between 2014 and 2018 - the RESIST 0/1 clinical - epidemiological study and the RESIST-2 study on the antibody response to the vaccine - provided the basis that allowed a change in international recommendations on PPE. Since April 2018, the new ""IPC protocol"" of three sessions of reduced double doses (0.1 mL x 2) administered intradermally (ID) over one week has replaced the already very effective ""TRC protocol"" of four sessions over one month which was the reference dose-sparing protocol for endemic countries until 2018. It remains to be determined whether the IPC protocol (3 sessions / 1 week) confers long-term immunity equivalent to that obtained after a TRC ID protocol (4 sessions / 1 month). This question is of importance to public health decision-makers and clinical teams in endemic countries who would hesitate to switch to the abbreviated IPC protocol.",Rabies
NCT00460525,Phase II AMA-1 Malaria Vaccine FMP2.1/AS02A Trial in Mali,"Malaria is a disease that affects many people in Africa. Malaria is caused by germs spread by mosquito bites. The purpose of this study is to compare the number of children who get malaria after receiving an experimental malaria vaccine (FMP2.1/AS02A) to the number of children who get malaria after receiving a vaccine for rabies (an approved vaccine that does not prevent malaria). The children will be assigned to one of the vaccine groups by chance. Participants and doctors will not know which vaccine was given. Study participants will include 400 children, ages 1-6 years, living in Bandiagara, Mali. Children will receive 3 vaccine doses, by injection, to their upper arm. Study procedures will include physical exams and several blood samples. Participants will be involved in the study for 26 months.",Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria
