NCT03276962,"Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity Study of GSK Biologicals' Candidate Malaria Vaccine (SB257049) Evaluating Schedules With or Without Fractional Doses, Early Dose 4 and Yearly Doses, in Children 5-17 Months of Age","The study intends to establish proof of concept for a fractional dose schedule under conditions of natural exposure in children 5-17 months old at first vaccination. The study also aims to establish the role of third dose spacing in a fractional dose schedule, describe the effect of an earlier full fourth dose at Month 14 and describe the effect of multiple fractional or full yearly doses.",Malaria
NCT03965962,Study of Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine Compared With Two Reference Rabies Vaccines in a Simulated Post-Exposure Regimen in Adults,"Primary Objective:To demonstrate that Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine - Serum Free Vaccine generation 2 (VRVg-2) was non-inferior to Verorab and Imovax Rabies vaccines when co-administered with human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG), in terms of proportion of participants achieving a rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titer greater than or equal to (\>=) 0.5 international units per milliliter (IU/mL) at Day 28, i.e., 14 days after the fourth vaccine injection.Secondary Objective:* To describe the safety profile of VRVg-2 versus Verorab and Imovax Rabies vaccines when co-administered with HRIG, as well as that of VRVg-2, after each vaccine injection.* To demonstrate that the proportion of participants in the VRVg-2 + HRIG group achieving an RVNA titer \>= 0.5 IU/mL at Day 28 was at least 95 percent (%).* To describe the immune response induced by VRVg-2 versus Verorab and Imovax Rabies vaccines when co-administered with HRIG, as well as that induced by VRVg-2, at Day 14 (7 days after the third injection), at Day 28 (14 days after the fourth injection) and at Day 42 (14 days after the last injection).",Rabies (Healthy Volunteers)
NCT00377494,"CS DNA MVA Trial in Mampong, Ghana","The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of 2 doses of a malaria vaccine (DNA) followed by a dose of another type of malaria vaccine (MVA) given as a ""booster."" Forty-eight adults in Ghana, ages 18-50 years, will participate for 17 months. They will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups. Group 1 will receive the DNA malaria vaccine at months 0 and 1, and the booster at month 7. Group 2 will receive a rabies vaccine at months 0 and 1, and an injection containing no vaccine at month 7. Group 3 will receive the DNA malaria vaccine at months 5 and 6, and the booster at month 7. Group 4 will receive the rabies vaccine at months 5 and 6, and an injection containing no vaccine at month 7. Blood samples and information regarding health problems that may occur after vaccination will be collected.",Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria
NCT05790889,A Study to Test Experimental Blood Stage Malaria Vaccine in Burkina Faso.,"This is a Phase IIb randomised controlled trial of the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the blood-stage malaria vaccine candidates RH5.1 in Matrix-MTM and RH5.2-VLP in Matrix-MTM in infants aged 5-17 months in Burkina Faso","Malaria,Falciparum"
NCT04019444,Dosage-Escalation Study of the Safety and Immunogenicity of a Novel Rabies Vaccine ChAd155-RG vs. the Comparator RABAVERT Vaccine in Healthy Adult Subjects,"This is a single-center, observer-blinded, dosage-escalation trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of ChAd155-RG compared with RABAVERT in rabies virus-na√Øve healthy male and non-pregnant female adult subjects ages 18-49. There are 4 dose groups: Group A will receive ChAd155-RG at the lower dosage (5x1010vp) on Day 1, then placebo injections on Days 8, 15, and 22; Group B will receive ChAd155-RG at the higher dosage (1x1011vp) on Day 1, then placebo injections on Days 8, 15, and 22; Group C will receive ChAd155-RG at the higher dosage (1x1011vp) on Days 1 and 15, and placebo injections on Days 8 and 22; Group D will receive RABAVERT at the standard dose (1 mL) on Days 1, 8, and 22, and a placebo injection on Day 15. Since this is a dosage-escalation study, sentinel subjects will be used at each dosage level before non-sentinel subjects will be enrolled. The study will be conducted at Emory University Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU). This trial is expected to take approximately 48 months to complete. The duration of each subject's participation is approximately 13 months, from recruitment through the last study visit. The primary objectives of this study are: 1) Assessment of the safety, tolerability, and reactogenicity of one dose of ChAd155-RG at 5x1010vp per dose, or one or two doses of ChAd155-RG at 1x1011vp per dose; 2) Comparison of the safety, tolerability, and reactogenicity of one or two doses of ChAd155-RG, with three doses of RABAVERT.",Rabies|Rabies Immunisation

NCT02956746,"A Comparison of the Safety, PD and PK of a Single Dose of SYN023 Administered With Licensed Rabies Vaccines","This is single site, randomized, blinded comparison of the immunogenicity, of Imovax (RVi) and Rabavert (RVa) rabies vaccines when subjects are administered rabies immune globulin (RIG) or SYN023. Subjects will be randomized into one of four dose groups: RVi + SYN023, RVi+RIG, RVa+SYN023 and RVa+RIG. The initial dose of RVi and RVa will be co-administered with either RIG or SYN023). Rabies virus neutralizing activity (RVNA) and blood levels of SYN023 will be measured for the remainder of the trial while the rest of the five RVi and RVa doses are given. The study will last 112 days. SYN023 concentrations and anti-SYN023 antibodies will also be measured.",Human Rabies
