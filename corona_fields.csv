NCT04127786,"Study of Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine Compared With Two Reference Rabies Vaccines, Given in a Pre-exposure Regimen to Children and Adults and as Single Booster Dose to a Subset of Adults","The primary objective of this study is:To demonstrate the Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine - Serum Free (VRVg-2) is non-inferior to Verorab and Imovax Rabies vaccines in each age group (pediatric and adult populations) when administered as a 3-dose pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimen, in terms of proportion of participants achieving a rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titer greater than or equal to (\>=) 0.5 IU/mL at Day (D) 42, i.e., 14 days after the 3rd injection (for Primary Series Cohort 1).The secondary objectives of this study are: First 1-5 with hypotheses testing will be evaluated sequentially - only if the previous objective is achieved, will the next objective be tested.To demonstrate that:* the observed proportion of participants in the VRVg-2 (VRVg) group at D42 is at least 99% with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of at least 97%* VRVg is non-inferior (NI) to Verorab and Imovax Rabies vaccines (Imovax) in each age group at D28* 2-dose VRVg at D28 is NI to 3-dose Imovax at D42 in each age group* the observed proportion of participants in the VRVg group at D28 is at least 99% with a lower limit of the 95% CI of at least 97%* 2-dose Imovax at D28 is NI to 3-dose Imovax at D42 in overall participants (Cohort 1)To describe:* the immune response induced by VRVg versus Verorab and Imovax at D28 and at D42 in all age groups* the immune response induced by VRVg at D14 after a booster dose of VRVg administered at Month (M) 12 (Cohort 1) and between M24 up to M36 (Cohort 2)* the persistence of immune response at M6,12,18, and pre-booster between M24 up to M36 post-primary series vaccination (Cohort 2)* safety profile of VRVg versus Verorab and Imovax in primary series and after a booster dose of VRVg.",Rabies (Healthy Volunteers)

NCT00872963,"An Extended Follow up of a RTS,S/AS01E Malaria Vaccine Trial","Malaria is one of the leading causes of deaths in children below five years old. Despite antimalarial drugs and insecticide treated bed nets, the established means of treatment and protection, malaria still continues to affect many children. A malaria vaccine would be a very effective way of reducing malaria infection in the community. RTS,S/AS01E is a leading malaria vaccine candidate which is being developed for children in Africa. The investigators have done a study to find out if this vaccine is effective in reducing infection by malaria in children aged 5-17 months living in Kenya and Tanzania. The follow up of the original study was 14-18 months. The extended follow up is proposed to continue for another four years.",Malaria

NCT03264157,Safety and Effectiveness of BPL HRIG With Active Rabies Vaccine in Healthy Subjects,"A prospective, randomized, blinded, parallel-group, non-inferiority, phase II/III study of the safety and effectiveness of simulated post-exposure prophylaxis with BPL HRIG with co-administration of active rabies vaccine in healthy subjects.",Healthy
NCT03131765,Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion Study of YS-ON-001 in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors,"Phase 1 study evaluating the safety and tolerability of YS-ON-001 in patients with advanced solid tumors who have limited available treatment options, and exploratory evaluation of the pharmacological effect and efficacy of YS-ON-001. The study will be conducted in two parts: dose escalation and cohort expansion",Cancer
NCT00000946,A Study to Test the Safety of Three Experimental HIV Vaccines,"The purpose of this study is to test three experimental HIV vaccines. This study will look at whether it is safe to give these vaccines together and how the immune system responds to the vaccines.There are a number of studies being performed to test HIV vaccines. The vaccines that seem to be the most promising are canarypox vaccines, known as ALVAC vaccines. The three experimental HIV vaccines used in this study are called ALVAC-HIV vCP205, HIV-1 SF-2 p24, and HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120. The HIV-1 SF-2 p24 and HIV-1 SF-2 rgp120 vaccines are mixed with an adjuvant, which is a substance that increases immune response.",HIV Infections|HIV Seronegativity
