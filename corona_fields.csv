NCT05596773,Community-Based Chronic Disease Care in Rural Lesotho,"This ComBaCaL cohort study is to assess the impact of community-based, lay-led chronic disease screening and care interventions in rural Lesotho. It aims to establish a prospective research and service delivery platform in rural Lesotho that is managed by eHealth-supported Chronic Care Village Health Worker (CC-VHWs) providing regular chronic disease screening, monitoring and referral services. The implementation outcomes of the cohort as well as the effect of the cohort activities on disease-specific care cascades will be assessed. Subsequently, nested trials to assess the effectiveness of specific chronic disease control interventions will be developed. Measurements and data entry will be conducted by CC-VHWs. The CC-VHWs will be equipped with the essential tools required for chronic disease monitoring in the community (i.e. BP machines, scales, measuring band, glucometers, and urine dipsticks). They will undergo a theoretical and practical training covering all aspects required for correct data collection and chronic disease screening, diagnosing, referral and counselling services. At every visit, the CC-VHW will screen participants for warning signs and symptoms (i.e. shortness of breath, severe headache, chest pain, new-onset confusion, impaired consciousness, severely impaired general state of health) and refer participants to the closest health centre in case of any danger-sign. The CC-VHWs will be continuously monitored and supervised by health centre nurses of the respective village's catchment area, mainly through direct interaction during monthly VHW meetings and by CC nurses through field visits, remote interaction via phone calls or messages sent via the ComBaCaL app and through direct contact during the monthly VHW meetings at the health centre. The CC-VHWs are embedded within the Lesotho MoH VHW program and may during the project period be trained and equipped to provide further routine services in their communities.",Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs)
NCT03403231,INcreasing Veteran EngagemeNT to Prevent Diabetes (INVENT),"This study will evaluate a VA MyHealtheVet Secure Messaging intervention that uses different intervention messaging strategies designed to increase engagement in behaviors to prevent type 2 diabetes.The investigators will enroll 144 eligible Veterans into a 12-week MyHealtheVet Secure Messaging intervention. Eligible Veterans include those who are currently using MyHealtheVet secure messaging, meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, and have received an HbA1c test within the last 6 months that meets the ADA/CDC classification for prediabetes. Study participants will be surveyed about their engagement in behaviors to prevent TDM2 and mediators of this engagement. After completing a baseline survey, participants will be randomly assigned to receive different novel presentations of information about ways to prevent T2DM through both Secure Messaging and US Mail. The investigators will test the 5 presentations that each: (1) represent an innovative approach from behavioral economics or health psychology with great promise to increase engagement in behaviors to prevent T2DM among patients with prediabetes; and (2) have not been tested in this setting.",Prediabetes
NCT01975376,The Evaluation of Bococizumab (PF-04950615;RN316) in Reducing the Occurrence of Major Cardiovascular Events in High Risk Subjects,"This study evaluates the PCSK9 inhibitor, Bococizumab (PF-04950615;RN316), compared to placebo, in reducing the occurrence of major cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and unstable angina requiring urgent revascularization, in high risk subjects who are receiving background lipid lowering therapy and have cholesterol laboratory values of LDL-C \>/= 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) or non-HDL-C \>/= 100 mg /dL (2.6 mmol/L).",Cardiovascular Disease
NCT03941860,"Testing the Addition of Ixazomib/Placebo to Lenalidomide in Patients With Evidence of Residual Multiple Myeloma, OPTIMUM Trial",This phase III trial studies how well lenalidomide in combination with ixazomib works compared to lenalidomide alone in treating patients with evidence of residual multiple myeloma after stem cell transplantation. Lenalidomide may help shrink or slow the growth of multiple myeloma. Ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving lenalidomide and ixazomib together may work better than giving lenalidomide alone in treating patients with evidence of residual multiple myeloma after a stem cell transplantation.,Multiple Myeloma
NCT06237660,Longitudinal Preschool Wheeze Biomarker Study,"Preschool children (aged 1-5 years) account for 75% of all UK childhood wheezing hospitalisations. This has not changed over 20 years, meaning current treatments are not working and a new approach is needed. Currently, all preschool wheezers are treated with inhaled steroids. However, only about 25% of patients, with allergies, respond well to inhaled steroidsÍ¾ for the other 75%, they are ineffective. This research group has found that some preschool wheezers may have other causes but there are no specific, non-invasive tests to match the right treatment to each child.The goal of this observational study is to test various bedside tests for this purpose in preschool children with wheeze, to see if they are feasible, accurate and acceptable in this age group.The research team would like to investigate the following aims:Aim 1 - To test the proposed panel of simple bedside tests below, to see how accurately they corelate with lower airway infection or inflammation.Aim 2 - To test the acceptability of these bedside tests are to parents and children, and if they reflect the child's symptoms, symptoms control and medication use.Aim 3- A small proof-of -concept study, to test if these simple bedside tests, can be used to determine treatment for each individual child.The panel of simple non-invasive tests that the research team are proposing are:1. Skin prick tests to common allergies (house dust mite, cat, dog, grass, tree pollen, mixed moulds)2. Finger prick blood test3. Phlegm test for bacteria4. Nose and throat swab for bacteria5. Lung function test called forced oscillation technique (FOT)",Wheezing
NCT01942694,Vitamin D and Type 2 Diabetes Study,The goal of the Vitamin D and type 2 diabetes (D2d) study is to determine if vitamin D supplementation works to delay the onset of type 2 diabetes in people at risk for the disease and to gain a better understand how vitamin D affects glucose (sugar) metabolism.,Prediabetes|Type 2 Diabetes
NCT00957294,Metabolic Syndrome in Patients With First-episode Schizophrenia,"The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is highly prevalent in patients with schizophrenia and is a major risk factor of type-2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and early death. Genetic factors, antipsychotic medication, sleeping disturbances and unhealthy lifestyle are possible causes of developing metabolic syndrome. Several studies have investigated the metabolic side-effects of antipsychotic medication. However it is still unanswered how unhealthy lifestyle, comprising physical inactivity, smoking, unhealthy dieting, and sleeping disturbances adds to the metabolic risk of patients with schizophrenia. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence and development of MetS in first-episode patients with schizophrenia and 1 year after onset of treatment. The study's main hypothesis is that physical inactivity, regardless of medication, is an independent risk factor for metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia. In comparison inpatients with major depression and healthy controls, both matched on gender, age and level of education will be included in the study. It is anticipated that the study's results will provide new knowledge about the risk of developing metabolic syndrome in first-episode schizophrenia and how different risk factors contribute to this.",Metabolic Syndrome X|Schizophrenia

Our hypothesis is that PF-00489791 will enhance the relaxation of blood vessels within the kidney and so reduce blood pressure, improving renal function.",Diabetic Nephropathies
NCT03152994,The Early Predictors for Developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), characterized by persistent airflow limitation, associated with an progressive chronic inflammatory response of the lung to noxious particles or gases, can lead to dyspnea and limited mobility and influence the life quality of patients severely. Type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM), as a common complication of COPD, has got more attention in comprehensive control of COPD. Stress response and metabolic disorder are more likely to happen in COPD patients with T2DM in high level inflammation status, which decrease the drug efficacy, increase the risk of acute exacerbation of COPD, complications and mortality.Both COPD and T2DM are chronic inflammatory disease with long term, there is close relationship in occurrence and development of each other, and the patients with severe COPD are more likely to develop T2DM. Monitoring the acute inflammation maker of C reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6(interleukin-6) is the most useable way to predict the inflammatory status and condition of COPD patient with T2DM, however the chronic inflammation maker is lacking. Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio(NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) , the new, cheap and easy-tested chronic inflammatory markers, have got great research in early predicting the tumor such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma and small-cell lung cancer,among them, NLR has manifest promising application in predicting insulin-resistance. However the value about NLR,PLR and LMR to predict the T2DM in COPD patients remain unknown and many articles related to NLR and COPD are retrospective.The investigators attempt to analyze the risk factors and predict value of NLR,PLR and LMR about developing T2DM in COPD patients with prospective method.",Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease|Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
