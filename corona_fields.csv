NCT00038974,Hepatitis C Antiviral Resistance in African-Americans,"This study is designed to test the hypothesis that African-Americans respond less well to combination pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy than Caucasian-Americans who have chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 and who were not previously treated with either interferon or ribavirin. Reasons for differences in response, regardless of race, will be studied.",Hepatitis C
NCT00547274,Dyslipidemia in Type 2 Diabetes (0767-034),"The purpose of the study is to compare the lipid-altering effects of MK0767, glipizide, and pioglitazone after 12 weeks of treatment.This is an early phase trial and some specific protocol information is in progress and not publicly available at this time. (Full information is available to trial participants).","Diabetes Mellitus, Type II|Dyslipidemia"
NCT02416765,Closed-loop Control of Postprandial Glucose Levels in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes,"Postprandial meal glucose control with closed-loop systems (CLS) still needs some improvements. In the postprandial period, sensor delay in detecting blood glucose rise after a meal together with delays in insulin absorption expose patients to early risk of hyperglycemia and then to late-postprandial hypoglycemia. Glucagon infusion in dual-hormone CLS has the potential to improve post-meal control as compared to single-hormone CLS allowing a better glucose excursion related to a more aggressive insulin infusion while minimizing hypoglycemic risk. Several approaches have been tested for the determination of prandial boluses during closed-loop operation.The objective of this study is to test in outpatient unrestricted settings whether, in the context of closed-loop strategy, conventional meal carbohydrate counting could be reduced to a simplified qualitative meal size estimation without a significant degradation in overall glycemic control in adult patients with type 1 diabetes.The investigators hypothesize that in outpatient free-living conditions: 1) Dual-hormone CLS with partial boluses is equivalent to dual-hormone CLS with full boluses in terms of mean glucose; 2) Single-hormone CLS with partial boluses is equivalent to single-hormone CLS with full boluses in terms of mean glucose. Secondary hypothesis are: 3) Dual-hormone CLS with partial boluses will decrease time in hypoglycemia compared to single-hormone CLS with partial boluses; 4) Dual-hormone CLS with partial boluses is better than sensor-augmented pump therapy in terms of mean glucose; 5) Single-hormone CLS with partial boluses is better than sensor-augmented pump therapy in terms of mean glucose.",Type 1 Diabetes
NCT05081765,The Effect of Glucose Level and Diabetes Mellitus on Ctrough of Olaparib,"Monitored therapy of olaparib concentrations in the blood of diabetic population probably will assess the need for individual dosing of the drug.The project concerns on the monitored therapy of olaparib in a population of patients with DM, hyperglycemia and normal glucose level.Currently, there are no studies assessing the effect of comorbidities and of the administered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of olaparib.",Ovary Cancer
NCT00280865,"GLAD: Dose-Finding, Efficacy, and Safety of AZ 242 (Tesaglitazar) in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes","This is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, multi-center, active-controlled (open-label pioglitazone) and placebo-controlled study of tesaglitazar (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 mg) in patients with type 2 diabetes, not adequately controlled on diet and lifestyle advice alone during the run-in period. The study comprises a 2-week enrollment period, 4 week placebo single blind run in period followed by a 12-week double blind treatment period and a 3-week follow-up period",Type 2 Diabetes
NCT04308265,Scoring System in Acute Calculous Cholecystitis,"Acute cholecystitis is a common disease in the daily practice of general surgery. There are various methods in the treatment of this disease, such as early cholecystectomy, medical treatment, six weeks later cholecystectomy and cholecystostomy. However, it is not satisfied with objective criteria that these methods are selected according to which patient groups. With this observational-prospective study, the benefit of first visit scoring on 'which of the treatment options will be most suitable for the patient' will be investigated. Thus, rare but severe complications of cholecystectomy can be prevented.",Acute Cholecystitis

NCT03754465,Clinical Study of ALLO-ASC-SHEET in Subjects with Diabetic Foot Ulcers,"This is a phase 2 double-blind clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and Safety of ALLO-ASC-SHEET in subjects with Diabetic Foot Ulcers, compared to placebo therapy.",Diabetic Foot Ulcer
NCT00773565,Identification of Novel Targets for Regulation of Adipose Tissue Mass,"The aim of this study is to understand the metabolic changes occurring in fat tissue both during controlled weight loss that lead to the improvement of type 2 diabetes and other obesity associated metabolic disorders. The novelty of the study is the analysis of preadipocytes, a poorly characterized subfraction of the adipose tissue, which provides adipocyte precursors and thereby strongly influences adipose tissue mass changes. Knowledge of pathways involved in controlling adipose tissue composition will help to design novel intervention strategies for the treatment of obesity associated metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.",Obesity
NCT01492166,"Observational Study on Efficacy, Safety and Convenience of Using Mixtard速 30 NovoLet速 Alone or Combined With OHA in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes in Routine Clinical Practice","This study is conducted in Asia. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy, safety and convenience of the use of Mixtard速 30 NovoLet速 used alone or combined with oral hypoglycaemic agent (OHA) in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in an out-patient setting.","Diabetes|Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"
