NCT03259789,Safety and Efficacy of Bexagliflozin Compared to Placebo as Add-on Therapy to Metformin in Type 2 Diabetes Subjects,The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of bexagliflozin compared to placebo as an add-on therapy to metformin in lowering hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).,Type2 Diabetes Mellitus
NCT06326489,Evaluating the Efficacy and Quality of Life Impact of Transitioning to Advanced Hybrid Closed-Loop Insulin Pump Therapy in Romanian Children With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,"The proposed study aims to demonstrate the potential benefits of transitioning T1DM children from predictive low glucose suspend insulin pump therapy to advanced hybrid closed-loop insulin pump therapy in Romania. Primary Outcome: Variations in HbA1c between baseline visit (V1 - 740G) and assessment visit following three months of 780G insulin pump therapy (V2 - 780G).Secondary Outcomes: changes in insulin requirements, time in range (TIR) levels, time below range (TBR), coefficient of variation (CV), frequency of severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events requiring hospitalization, and PedsQL SF15 questionnaire scores.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1"
NCT00572689,Pilot Study of Exenatide Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics in Gestational Diabetes,"This study is being done to study how exenatide, an FDA-approved drug that lowers blood sugar in non-pregnant patients with type II diabetes, works in pregnant women. To do this, we will study the drug's pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the drug; specifically, how quickly your body breaks down and excretes exenatide) and pharmacodynamics (what the drug does to the body; specifically, how effectively exenatide helps your pancreas secrete insulin and how well it controls blood sugar after a meal). There are only two main drug therapies (insulin injections and glyburide pills) currently used for gestational diabetes and not all women achieve good enough blood sugar control without side effects. Therefore, we hope to find out if exenatide might also be helpful in gestational diabetes.",Gestational Diabetes
NCT02414529,Efficacy of Vitamin D Therapy on Glucose Homeostasis in Obese Adolescents,The purpose of this study is to see whether giving a Vitamin D supplement to vitamin D deficient obese children and adolescents will decrease the risk of getting diabetes (Disease in which the person has high blood sugar).The number of vitamin D deficiency in U.S. children and teenagers has grown dramatically over the past 30 years. There are some reports suggesting that vitamin D supplementation in adults with pre diabetes (blood glucose higher than normal) and vitamin D treatment will prevent diabetes.,Vitamin D Deficiency
NCT03687229,The Effect Of DAAs on miRNA-122 And Insulin Resistance In Chronic HCV Patients,"The hepatitis C virus is a major cause of chronic liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and infects approximately 3 % of the world population (150-170 million). It is estimated that approximately 80 % of patients with acute hepatitis C fail to eliminate the virus and become chronically infected Hepatitis C virus infection is strongly associated with the dysregulation of glucose homoeostasis such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Despite these findings of insulin resistance development via direct effects on insulin signalling pathway, the complex relationship between intrahepatic Hepatitis C virus infection and extrahepatic insulin resistance remains elusive.One of the countries most affected by Hepatitis C virus is Egypt. The Egyptian Demographic and Health Surveys measured antibody prevalence among the adult population aged 15-59 years at 10.0% in 2015-substantially higher than global levels.Several micro ribonucleic acids have been determined to play a key role in regulating viral replication and pathogenesis during infection. micro ribonucleic acid-122 expression is enriched in the liver, accounting for approximately 70 % of the total micro ribonucleic acid population in normal adult hepatocytes. Moreover, a particularly intriguing function of micro ribonucleic acid-122 involves its role in the Hepatitis C virus replication cycle.Antagonism of micro ribonucleic acid-122 not only reduces viral replication but also reduces Hepatitis C virus propagation by decreasing the expression of enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, which can enhance Hepatitis C virus replication in cell culture models.",Chronic Hepatitis c
NCT05916729,Use of Maqui Berry Extract in Treating Oral Candidiasis in Diabetes Mellitus Patients and Systemically Healthy Persons,"Fungi from the genus Candida present the saprophytic flora of the cavity. This saprophytic yeast can cause different form of oral infections at immunocompromised patients as well as at subjects with impaired local oral microbiota e.g. wearers of dentures.The most common cause of oral candidiasis is Candida albicans, but recently, non-albicans species has also been commonly isolated. One of the reasons for growing frequency of non-albicans species is traditional antifungal therapy. Standard antifungal therapy, which means elimination of yeasts, lead to antimicrobial resistance, dysbiosis and higher incidence of non-albicans species In order to overcome these limitations, the new antimicrobial therapy is based on anti-virulence strategy. This approach relays on disarming the microorganism, instead of killing or stopping their growth, which is especially important for saprophytes.In case of Candida albicans the main goal is preventing transition from cell to hyphal form.",Oral Candidiases
NCT04243629,Co-administration of Pramlintide and Insulin Via an Automated Dual-hormone Artificial Pancreas System in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes,"One of the main challenges in maintaining tight glucose control in a closed-loop system occurs at meal times. Amylin is a gluco-regulatory beta-cell hormone that is co-secreted with insulin in response to nutrient stimuli, and is deficient in patients with type 1 diabetes. Amylin, in the postprandial period, contributes to regulating glucose levels by delaying gastric emptying, suppressing nutrient-stimulated glucagon secretion, and increasing satiety. Pramlintide is a synthetic analog of the hormone amylin. A closed-loop system that delivers both insulin and pramlintide, based on glucose sensor readings, has the potential to better normalize glucose levels, especially during the post-prandial period.The aim of this project is to assess whether co-administration of pramlintide with rapid insulin in an artificial pancreas system will improve glycemic control in adults with Type 1 Diabetes.","Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1|Type 1 Diabetes|Postprandial Hyperglycemia"
