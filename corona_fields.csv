NCT03264157,Safety and Effectiveness of BPL HRIG With Active Rabies Vaccine in Healthy Subjects,"A prospective, randomized, blinded, parallel-group, non-inferiority, phase II/III study of the safety and effectiveness of simulated post-exposure prophylaxis with BPL HRIG with co-administration of active rabies vaccine in healthy subjects.",Healthy

NCT04829630,Immunity Persistence After Abridged Intradermal Rabies PEP,"After exposure, rabies can be prevented in almost 100% of cases by the administration of sufficient and timely post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP is based on wound cleansing, antisepsis, administration of rabies vaccine as well as rabies immunoglobulin, if reviewed. However, anti-rabies PEP remains too often out of financial and / or geographic access, especially for poor and / or rural populations in endemic countries who remain the most exposed to the risk of contracting rabies. Two major studies planned in Cambodia between 2014 and 2018 - the RESIST 0/1 clinical - epidemiological study and the RESIST-2 study on the antibody response to the vaccine - provided the basis that allowed a change in international recommendations on PPE. Since April 2018, the new ""IPC protocol"" of three sessions of reduced double doses (0.1 mL x 2) administered intradermally (ID) over one week has replaced the already very effective ""TRC protocol"" of four sessions over one month which was the reference dose-sparing protocol for endemic countries until 2018. It remains to be determined whether the IPC protocol (3 sessions / 1 week) confers long-term immunity equivalent to that obtained after a TRC ID protocol (4 sessions / 1 month). This question is of importance to public health decision-makers and clinical teams in endemic countries who would hesitate to switch to the abbreviated IPC protocol.",Rabies

NCT05135273,Study of the Transmission-Blocking Vaccine Pfs230D1-EPA/Matrix-M Against Malaria in Adults in Mali,"Background:Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine that will safely reduce the spread of malaria in the community by preventing mosquitos from carrying malaria from person to person.Objective:To assess in African adults the safety of and immune response to the administration of Pfs230D1-EPA/Matrix-M vaccine as compared to the rabies vaccine control.Eligibility:Healthy adults (18 to 50 years of age) who reside in Sotuba and surrounding villages in MaliDesign:Participants will be screened with:* Medical history* Physical exam* Blood, urine, and heart tests* Malaria comprehension examParticipants will be randomly assigned to get either the experimental vaccine or the approved rabies vaccine. They will not know which they are getting.Participants will get 3 doses of the study or comparator vaccine via injection in the upper arm. This occurs at the first visit, 1 month, and 2 months later.Participants will have up to 23 scheduled visits over 14 to 16 months. Each visit includes a physical exam, and blood will be collected at most visits.Participants will be followed up to 1 year after the final vaccination.If participants develop an injection site rash or reaction, photographs may be taken of the site.","Malaria,Falciparum"
NCT05832073,"Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamic Testing of Rabies mAb CBB 1","rabies mab CBB 1 is mainly used for passive immunization of patients bitten or scratched by rabies or other animals carrying rabies virus, this study mainly studies the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, neutralizing antibody activity and immunogenic characteristics of rabies mAb CBB 1 in healthy adults",Rabies Virus Infection
NCT04342182,Convalescent Plasma as Therapy for Covid-19 Severe SARS-CoV-2 Disease (CONCOVID Study),"Passive immunization with immunoglobulins is occasionally used as therapy for the treatment of viral infectious diseases. Immunoglobulins are used for the treatment of CMV disease, and is effective as prophylaxis when given soon after exposure to varicella zoster virus, rabies, and hepatitis B virus.Neutralizing antibodies against MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 have been shown to be present in patients previously infected with MERS, SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 respectively. During the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong-Kong,a non-randomized study in hospitalized SARS patients showed that treatment with convalescent plasma (convP) from SARS-recovered donors significantly increased the day 22 discharge rate and decreased mortality. A study in non-human primates showed that rhesus macaques could not be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2 after primary infection.With no proven effective therapy against COVID, this study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma from COVID-recovered donors as a treatment for hospitalized patients with symptomatic COVID-19. The study will focus on patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the last 96 hours before inclusionPrimary objectivesâ€¢ Decrease overall mortality in patients within COVID diseaseStudy design:This trial is a randomized comparative trial. Patients will be randomized between the infusion of 300mL of convP with standard of care.Patient population:Patients with PCR confirmed COVID disease, age \>18 years Donors will be included with a known history of COVID who have been asymptomatic for at least 14 days.Intervention: 300mL of convP Duration of treatment: ConvP will be given as a one-time infusion Duration of follow up: For the primary endpoint: until discharge or death before day 60, whichever comes first. For the secondary endpoints (with separate consent) up to 1 year.Target number of patients: 426 Target number of donors: 100 Expected duration of accrural: 36 months",COVID-19

NCT03276962,"Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity Study of GSK Biologicals' Candidate Malaria Vaccine (SB257049) Evaluating Schedules With or Without Fractional Doses, Early Dose 4 and Yearly Doses, in Children 5-17 Months of Age","The study intends to establish proof of concept for a fractional dose schedule under conditions of natural exposure in children 5-17 months old at first vaccination. The study also aims to establish the role of third dose spacing in a fractional dose schedule, describe the effect of an earlier full fourth dose at Month 14 and describe the effect of multiple fractional or full yearly doses.",Malaria
