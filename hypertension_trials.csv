NCT03678831,"Characteristics of Marrow Fatty Cells in the Ageing of Bone and Joints, Osteoarthritis and Osteoporosis","Obesity and other associated complications promote the development and the progression of osteoarthritis. The subcutaneous and abdominal fat release several factors that alter bone and the cartilage. The role of the marrow fat in close connection with bone has not been defined yet, whereas cellular and animal models indicate that this fat depot modifies bone and cartilage.The aim of the study is to define if the marrow fat produces more joint-altering factors by comparison with subcutaneous fat. This fat depot can be characterized from removed pieces during the prosthetic surgery of the knee. Measuring before surgery the body weight, waist and hip circumferences, blood pressure, glucose, insulin and lipids in blood will also allow to determine if obesity and/or type 2 diabetes make this fat more dangerous for the joint. Such research will allow the elaboration of new therapeutic strategies in osteoarthritis.","Osteoarthritis, Knee|Prosthesis User"

NCT01700231,Plasma and Hemodynamic Markers During Hepatectomy,"Introduction Liver resection is considered the only curative treatment option for mCRC patients without extrahepatic disease and is accepted practice. Despite substantial improvements in surgical techniques, postoperative morbidity and mortality remain an important concern after major resections. Complications of liver resection, although rare, include liver failure and acute kidney injury as indicated by oliguria and increased serum creatinine. The underlying pathophysiological pathways of post-operative renal alteration following liver resection is an increase in portal venous pressure, based on observations in animal models or small cohorts. The corpus of data is derived from patients with liver cirrhosis and subsequent hepatorenal syndrome. These data are limited since cirrhosis cannot distinguish between metabolic changes, portal hypertension and impaired liver function in the elucidation of the pathogenesis of renal alterations. Liver resection is therefore a potent model to evaluate the impact of portal hypertension on the kidney despite stable liver function.The most significant factor determining morbidity and mortality following hepatectomy is the ability of the remnant liver to regenerate. In this context, several growth factors were shown to regulate the highly orchestrated process of liver regeneration (LR).Hypothesis The investigators will therefore test the hypothesis that liver resection leads to a sustained increase of portalvenous pressure with a subsequent episode of oliguric renal impairment, correlating with the quantity of resected liver.Furthermore, the investigators will examine the relationship between postoperative liver regeneration and circulating growth factor levels in patients undergoing hepatectomy. Based on the preclinical data the investigators hypothesize that a circulating growth factor levels will be associated with delayed liver regeneration, an increased incidence of postoperative liver dysfunction and concomitant worse clinical outcome.","Hepatorenal Syndrome, Liver Regeneration"

NCT04971720,PRECISION-BP: Precision Chronopharamacotherapy Targeting NP-RAAS-BP Rhythm Axis,Obese individuals have a higher prevalence of nocturnal hypertension and non-dipping blood pressure (BP). These conditions are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and death. Natriuretic Peptides (NPs) are hormones produced by the heart which directly regulate BP by causing dilation of blood vessels and by removing sodium and water from the body. NPs have a 24-hour day-night rhythm and this controls the day-night rhythm of BP as well. The NP-BP rhythm relationship is broken down in obese individuals. Obese individuals also have lower circulating NP levels. Lower circulating levels of NPs and elevated renin hormone (a part of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System \[RAAS\]) at nighttime may contribute to the high nocturnal blood pressure in obese individuals which puts them at a higher risk of developing CV events. This current study seeks to determine the biological implications of chronopharmacology for synchronizing NP-RAAS-based blood pressure therapy with the physiological diurnal rhythms to restore the normal diurnal rhythm of blood pressure in obese individuals.,Obesity|Cardiovascular Diseases|Hypertension|Nocturnal Blood Pressure|Natriuretic Peptides|Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System

NCT03058874,Effect of Dry-weight Probing Guided by Lung-Ultrasound on Ambulatory Blood Pressure and Arterial Stiffness in Hemodialysis Patients (LUST Sub-Study),"The most common co-morbidity accompanying Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is hypertension, which appears in approximately 80% of all patients with renal dysfunction, whereas its prevalence in general population is remarkably lower appearing in approximately 30% of adults.Defining hypertension in ESRD patients under maintenance dialysis is a challenging procedure. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is considered the ""gold standard"" for the diagnosis of hypertension in hemodialysis patients over the last years. The major pathophysiologic mechanism underlying hypertension development in patients with ESRD under hemodialysis is water and sodium overload.Identifying an accurate and objective method of dry weight evaluation has been a matter of intensive nephrology research for more than two decades. Assessment of the water balance in hemodialysis patients on the basis of common clinical criteria (e.g. leg or face swelling or signs of lung congestion) is a subjective method with limited reliability, despite its widespread use. Recently, a novel technique has been developed to quantify water excess by conducting an ultrasound lung scan. Pilot studies have shown significant changes in lung water in hemodialysis patients according to body weight changes during interdialytic days and dialysis sessions. Moreover, results from previous studies indicate significant benefits from dry weight probing with regards to blood pressure (BP).The clinical application of a lung-ultrasound-based volume control strategy in hemodialysis patients is currently being tested by the randomized study entitled ""Lung water by ultrasound guided treatment to prevent death and cardiovascular complications in high risk end stage renal disease patients with cardiomyopathy (The LUST Study)"". This clinical trial aims at evaluating whether the use of the number of US-B lines could be used as a biomarker to guide a per-protocol intensification of ultrafiltration (UF) in order to reduce volume overload, improve cardiac function and prolong survival.Cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD is attributed to a spectrum of structural and functional alterations of the large and the small branches of the arterial tree. The most important process in patients with advanced CKD is that of arteriosclerosis, which is developed in parallel to atherosclerosis and is typically associated with impaired cushioning function of the aorta and the large conduit arteries. Accelerated arterial stiffening is involved in the development of isolated systolic hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and congestive heart failure (CHF), which predispose to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In the context of the phenomenon of ""aortic-to-brachial BP amplification"", systolic BP (SBP) and pulse pressure (PP) conventionally measured at the level of brachial artery are higher than the relevant pressures in the ascending aorta. Due to extreme elevation of arterial stiffness, BP amplification is disturbed in patients with ESRD. Prospective cohort studies have demonstrated that elevated central PP, wave reflections and arterial stiffness, as well as, reduced PP amplification represent strong and independent predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients. On this basis, estimation of central BP indices appears as an important tool towards optimisation of cardiovascular risk stratification in ESRD as well as in other diseased populations.Until recently, available devices for ABPM evaluated BP levels only at the level of brachial artery. The newly developed Mobil-O-Graph NG (IEM, Stolberg, Germany) provides the ability to monitor central aortic pressure and indices of vascular resistance, such as wave reflections (augmentation index, AIx) and arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity, PWV).This device has recently been validated in hemodialysis patients and showed comparable performance with the widely used tonometric SphygmoCor device (ArtCor, Sydney, Australia). Accumulated evidence over central BP and PWV in hemodialysis patients derives mostly from studies that included only static pre-dialysis and post-dialysis measurements. However, variations of BP levels during intra- and interdialytic intervals combined with the superiority of aortic BP measurements, as analysed above, indicate that ambulatory monitoring of central BP is the best available method.This study aims for the first time to evaluate the outcome of a treatment strategy for dry weight probing, based on volume overload quantification with lung ultrasound, on 48-hour peripheral systolic BP, aortic BP and arterial stiffness in hemodialysis hypertensive patients.This is a Lust Sub-Study.
