NCT04829630,Immunity Persistence After Abridged Intradermal Rabies PEP,"After exposure, rabies can be prevented in almost 100% of cases by the administration of sufficient and timely post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP is based on wound cleansing, antisepsis, administration of rabies vaccine as well as rabies immunoglobulin, if reviewed. However, anti-rabies PEP remains too often out of financial and / or geographic access, especially for poor and / or rural populations in endemic countries who remain the most exposed to the risk of contracting rabies. Two major studies planned in Cambodia between 2014 and 2018 - the RESIST 0/1 clinical - epidemiological study and the RESIST-2 study on the antibody response to the vaccine - provided the basis that allowed a change in international recommendations on PPE. Since April 2018, the new ""IPC protocol"" of three sessions of reduced double doses (0.1 mL x 2) administered intradermally (ID) over one week has replaced the already very effective ""TRC protocol"" of four sessions over one month which was the reference dose-sparing protocol for endemic countries until 2018. It remains to be determined whether the IPC protocol (3 sessions / 1 week) confers long-term immunity equivalent to that obtained after a TRC ID protocol (4 sessions / 1 month). This question is of importance to public health decision-makers and clinical teams in endemic countries who would hesitate to switch to the abbreviated IPC protocol.",Rabies

NCT06558942,Incisional Negative Pressure Therapy to Prevent Animal Induced Wound Infection,"Animal injuries are a significant public health issue, with the most common being bites or scratches from cats and dogs. Every year, over 40 million people in China are bitten or scratched by cats and dogs, which can lead to wound infections and even systemic complications, with infection rates ranging from 10% to 80%. However, there is still no better way to reduce wound infection rates in current clinical studies and guidelines.Incisional negative pressure wound therapy (iNPWT) is a new wound treatment technology developed in recent years. It creates a negative pressure environment on sutured or closed wounds, helps to fix the edges of the incision together, reduce lateral tension on the wound, stimulate blood perfusion at the edge of the wound, remove fluid from the wound, and act as an external pollution barrier. INPWT has been widely used for postoperative wound healing in surgery, but there is currently a lack of effective clinical trials on its ability to prevent wound infections caused by animal injuries and promote wound healing.This study aims to apply iNPWT technology to the wounds of patients with rabies grade III exposure who underwent primary suturing, and compare it with wounds covered with ordinary gauze after previous primary suturing to determine whether it can help reduce postoperative incision infection rates and promote wound healing. This will provide high-quality clinical evidence for the widespread use of wound management in rabies grade III exposure patients in the future.",Injury Caused by Animal Bites|Wound Infection

NCT04644484,A Phase III Clinical Study to Evaluate SYN023's Efficacy and Safety,"This is a Phase 3, blinded, randomized study of SYN023 compared to a China licensed Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (a Rabies immune globulin from human sources, HRIG) for the prevention of rabies as part of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). The trial will enroll the World Health Organization (WHO) Category III rabies exposure subjects. The subject's death and rabies data will be reviewed by Data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) to confirm the safety. Besides, rabies vaccine would be administered after Study Drug in each group.This trial is proposed to further the licensure of SYN023 to provide an effective PEP alternative available to those exposed persons who need such a product. A placebo-controlled rabies trial is unethical thus HRIG is selected as the control group. Rabies immune globulin from equine and human sources (HRIG) have been evaluated in many trials and HRIG is the standard of care in China.",Rabies|Communicable Disease|Virus Diseases|Rhabdoviridae Infections|Mononegavirales Infections|RNA Virus Infections
NCT00000884,A Randomized Phase I Safety and Immunogenicity Trial of Live Recombinant Canarypox ALVAC-HIV vCP205 Delivered by Alternate Mucosal Routes in HIV-1 Uninfected Adult Volunteers,"To compare the safety of ALVAC-HIV vCP205 to that of ALVAC-RG vCP65 rabies glycoprotein, delivered by a variety of mucosal routes. To evaluate the antibody, humoral, and cellular immune responses resulting from ALVAC-HIV vCP205. \[AS PER AMENDMENT 8/3/98: To obtain safety data on AIDSVAX B/B boosting administered by the intramuscular and intranasal routes in the context of previous immunization via alternate mucosal routes or intramuscularly with a canarypox vector expressing HIV-1 antigens (vCP205). To obtain immunogenicity data on AIDSVAX B/B boosting.\] One of the earliest observations in the HIV epidemic was the demonstration of HIV infection at mucosal surfaces of cells in the genital tract. These data suggest that priming of immune defenses of viral infected cells may be an important component in the strategy of developing an effective HIV vaccine. Direct immunization of relevant mucosal surfaces with a vectored vaccine may stimulate mucosal immunity. The ALVAC-HIV vCP205 immunogen is constructed from a live recombinant canarypox vector that has a good safety profile in volunteers and should allow mucosal induction of immunity.",HIV Infections

NCT03667079,Integrating Community Interventions to Eliminate Neglected Tropical Diseases,"The overarching goal of this project is the elimination of two neglected tropical diseases (NTD):soil-transmitted helminthiasis and rabies. The specific objective of this pilot study was:To determine whether the integrated delivery platform improved the cost-effectiveness and coverage of MDA targeting STH and rabies;The investigators integrated two public health initiatives: 1) a mass drug administration (MDA) effort to eliminate neglected tropical diseases (NTD) caused by soil-transmitted helminths (STH), with 2) a community-valued mass dog rabies vaccination (MDRV) intervention to eliminate human and animal rabies, also a priority NTD of the World Health Organisation. The goal of MDA efforts targeting STH is to reduce worm burdens to very low levels below which self-sustaining transmission, and the public health consequences of STH, cease. Existing school-based delivery programs fail to reach all affected age groups, however, which results in ineffective coverage levels and persistence of STH. The goal of MDRV is to immunize 70% of dog populations, after which canine-mediated rabies is eliminated. MDRV programs are typically very popular, with all human age groups participating. The objectives of this project were to determine whether supplementing a strictly school-based MDA NTD control program with a community-wide strategy that is coupled to an MDRV program will result in a synergism that (a) improves coverage, reach and cost-effective delivery of MDA targeting STH and (b) improves coverage and cost-effective delivery of dog vaccination. To achieve this, research activities, comprised of post-intervention household questionnaire surveys, were carried out. In addition detailed cost data was collected.",Rabies in Animals|Worms; Intestine
