NCT00842530,Efficacy and Safety of Dengue Vaccine in Healthy Children,"The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of CYD dengue vaccine after three injections in preventing symptomatic virologically-confirmed dengue (VCD) cases, regardless of the severity, due to any of the four serotypes in children aged 4 to 11 years at the time of inclusion.Secondary objectives included to assess:* Vaccine efficacy against severe VCD cases* Vaccine efficacy against VCD cases following at least two injections with CYD dengue vaccine* Immune response to CYD dengue vaccine* Safety profile of CYD dengue vaccine. Safety assessments include solicited reactions within 7 or 14 days after each injection, unsolicited adverse events within 28 days after each injection, and serious adverse events during the study period.Other objectives included:* Vaccine efficacy against VCD cases following at least one injection with CYD dengue vaccine* Vaccine efficacy against VCD cases due to each serotype* Participants with clinical signs and symptoms for VCD",Dengue Virus|Dengue Fever|Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever|Dengue Diseases
NCT03169725,A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of Inactivated Poliomyelitis Vaccine in Healthy Infants,The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine based on Sabin strain (LBVC) in healthy infants to select optimal dose of LBVC as well as to demonstrate the lot-to-lot consistency and non-inferiority of LBVC.,Poliomyelitis
NCT01666925,Efficacy of Malaria Vaccines in Kenyan Adults,"Malaria transmission is falling in some parts of Africa as bed nets and anti-malarials become more widely available. However, transmission still persists and it appears that additional control measures are required. The leading malaria vaccine candidate in development is RTS,S which has efficacy against clinical malaria measured at 30-50% in the field. This partial protection might be enhanced by combination with other components. The other vaccination approach that has produced repeatable efficacy in humans is the use of viral vectors to induce T cell responses. Previous attempts with this vaccine approach have been effective in challenge studies in Oxford, but ineffective in the field, probably because of reduced immunogenicity.Recently, studies in Oxford, Kenya and the Gambia have shown higher levels of immunogenicity by using a chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAd63) followed by an attenuated vaccinia virus (modified vaccinia Ankara) to deliver the pre-erythrocytic antigen, multiple epitope string with thrombospondin- related adhesion protein (ME-TRAP).The increase in immunogenicity has lead to sterile protection in 3 out of 14 volunteers and partial protection in 5 out of 14 volunteers in challenge studies.The investigators propose a Phase 2b study of 120 healthy adult men in Kenya. The investigators will assess the efficacy and further evaluate the immunogenicity and safety profile of the vaccine regimen. The investigators also intend to assess the correlates of efficacy and natural immunity.",Malaria
NCT00703066,Safety and Immunogenicity of 30 and 100 µg of GMZ2 in Gabonese Children Aged 1-5 Years,"The study aims to show that the candidate malaria vaccine GMZ2 is as safe as the already publicly used vaccine against rabies. 30 Gabonese children aged 1-5 years will be enrolled and randomly allocated to receive either malaria vaccine or rabies vaccine without the investigator or the participants knowing what they received. They will receive 3 doses each at one month intervals, and will be followed up for one year to evaluate safety parameters. 30 and 100µg doses for the candidate malaria vaccine GMZ 2 will be evaluated for safety.This is the second time that candidate malaria vaccine GMZ 2 is being tested in Africa, the first time being in Gabonese adults where the product was found to be safe.",Malaria
NCT01930357,Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine-Serum Free Compared to Human Diploid Cell Vaccine in a Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Regimen,"The aim of the study is to document immunogenicity and safety of VRVg in a pre-exposure regimen in healthy children and adolescents aged 2 to 17 years.Primary Objectives:* To demonstrate that VRVg is non-inferior to Imovax® Rabies in terms of proportion of subjects achieving a rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) titer ≥ 0.5 international units (IU)/mL at D42, i.e. 14 days after the last vaccination.* To describe if at least 99% of subjects achieve an RVNA titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL at D42 with a lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of at least 97%, in the VRVg group.Secondary Objectives:* To assess the clinical safety of each vaccine after each vaccine injection when administered in a pre-exposure schedule.* To describe the immune response induced by each vaccine 14 days after the last vaccination, i.e. at D42, and 6 months after the first vaccination* To describe the geometric mean titer ratio between the two vaccine groups at D42, i.e. 14 days after the last vaccination.",Rabies

NCT04829630,Immunity Persistence After Abridged Intradermal Rabies PEP,"After exposure, rabies can be prevented in almost 100% of cases by the administration of sufficient and timely post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP is based on wound cleansing, antisepsis, administration of rabies vaccine as well as rabies immunoglobulin, if reviewed. However, anti-rabies PEP remains too often out of financial and / or geographic access, especially for poor and / or rural populations in endemic countries who remain the most exposed to the risk of contracting rabies. Two major studies planned in Cambodia between 2014 and 2018 - the RESIST 0/1 clinical - epidemiological study and the RESIST-2 study on the antibody response to the vaccine - provided the basis that allowed a change in international recommendations on PPE. Since April 2018, the new ""IPC protocol"" of three sessions of reduced double doses (0.1 mL x 2) administered intradermally (ID) over one week has replaced the already very effective ""TRC protocol"" of four sessions over one month which was the reference dose-sparing protocol for endemic countries until 2018. It remains to be determined whether the IPC protocol (3 sessions / 1 week) confers long-term immunity equivalent to that obtained after a TRC ID protocol (4 sessions / 1 month). This question is of importance to public health decision-makers and clinical teams in endemic countries who would hesitate to switch to the abbreviated IPC protocol.",Rabies
