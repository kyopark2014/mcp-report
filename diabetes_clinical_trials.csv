NCT04417127,Harambee: Integrated Community-based HIV/NCD Care & Microfinance Groups in Kenya,"The objective of this project is to demonstrate the effectiveness and longer-term sustainability of a differentiated care delivery model for improving HIV treatment outcomes. The central hypothesis is that the integration of community-based HIV and NCD care with group microfinance will improve retention in care and rates of viral suppression (VS) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Kenya via two mechanisms: improved household economic status and easier access to care.The specific aims are as follows:1. To evaluate the extent to which integrated community-based HIV care with group microfinance affects retention in care and VS among n=900 PLHIV in rural western Kenya using a cluster randomized intervention design of n=40 existing (fully HIV+) microfinance groups to receive either: (A) integrated community-based HIV and NCD care or (B) standard care. Data from the two trial arms will be augmented with a matched contemporaneous control group of n=300 patients receiving standard care and not involved in microfinance (group C), comparing outcomes in groups A, B and C. The hypothesize is that A \> B \> C in terms of viral suppression and retention in care.2. To identify specific mechanisms through which microfinance and integrated community-based care impact VS. Using a mixed methods approach, the study will characterize the mechanisms of effect on patient outcomes. Investigators will conduct quantitative mediation analysis to examine two main mediating pathways (household economic conditions and easier access to care), as well as exploratory mechanisms (food security, social support, HIV- related stigma). Investigators will also use qualitative methods and multi-stakeholder panels to contextualize implementation of the intervention.3. To assess the cost-effectiveness of microfinance and integrated community-based care delivery to maximize future policy and practice relevance of this promising intervention strategy. The working hypothesis is that the differentiated model will be cost-effective in terms of cost per HIV suppressed person-time, cost per patient retained in care, and cost per disability-adjusted life year saved.The main expected outcomes will be rigorous evidence of effectiveness, mechanisms and cost-effectiveness of a differentiated model for achieving the last key step in the HIV care continuum. These results are expected to have an important positive impact in terms of improved, high-quality services that address known individual and structural barriers to care and promote long-term sustainability of care for PLHIV in rural settings with high HIV prevalence.",HIV/AIDS|Noncommunicable Diseases|Hypertension|Diabetes

NCT03383627,Assessment of Glycemic Control in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Late Stage Chronic Kidney Disease,"Diabetes control is often assessed by tests of glucose levels over time, such as the glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fructosamine. In the later stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) there is limited data available on the utility of these tests. There are reasons to believe that the tests may be less accurate in this population. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) offers an effective method for understanding the totality of glucose exposure and incidence of both hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic excursions.",Diabetes|Kidney Diseases

NCT01462227,Effect of Naltrexone on Counterregulatory Mechanisms in Hypoglycemia,"Insulin treatment often causes the blood glucose levels to fall too low. The body usually responds to low blood glucose levels by releasing hormones which act against the insulin to help correct the low blood glucose levels. However, this hormone response can be altered in people with diabetes. Currently there are no therapeutic agents that can be used to improve the recovery from hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Naltrexone is a tablet used to help people who are addicted to alcohol or morphine-based drugs to remain drug and alcohol-free but it can also affect the levels of the hormones which are released during hypoglycemia. The aim of this study is to determine whether naltrexone can be used to improve and accelerate the recovery from hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes.",Hypoglycemia

NCT04945473,Gastric Recalibration After Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty,"Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a technique used for bariatric surgery, with results comparable to conventional surgery, in order to treat morbid obesity. It has also less risks of complications, and it is not an irreversible technique. It can be repeated overtime, regarding the evolution of the gastroplasty. There is little data in the literature on the effectiveness of endoscopic ""revision"". This study will assess the benefits and costs of a revision during the follow-up endoscopy.",Morbid Obesity
NCT00609973,Ciprofloxacin for the Prevention of Postoperative Endoscopic Recurrence in Crohn's Disease,"Despite extensive medical treatment, surgical resection is required in approximately 70% of the patients at some time. However, recurrence of the disease after operation occurs in the majority of patients and is a serious limitation of surgical management. Therapeutic options to maintain postoperative clinical remission are urgently needed. Several drugs including mesalazine, antibiotics (metronidazole, ornidazole) and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine have been studied in the past. But the efficacy is very limited (mesalazine), overshadowed by intolerability during long-term therapy (metronidazole, ornidazole) or inconclusive (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine). Research demonstrating the absence of inflammation in patients with diverting ileostomy and the clinical benefit of a postoperative antibiotic therapy using metronidazole or ornidazole implicates a role of the resident bacterial flora in the postoperative relapse. Ciprofloxacin has a broad antibacterial spectrum. More interestingly it also suppresses E. coli strains, which can be found in high numbers in early and chronic ileal lesions of Crohn's disease patients Ciprofloxacin has demonstrated beneficial effects in the therapy of inflammatory bowel diseases, but the available data of the effectiveness of ciprofloxacin allow only a very limited judgement of the safety and tolerability of a 6 months therapy of ciprofloxacin. Therefore an exploratory multicenter prospective, placebo-controlled trial is planned to analyze the safety and tolerability of a 6 months therapy with ciprofloxacin compared to placebo in 40 patients (randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio) undergoing ileocecal resection (or resection of parts of the colon). If this therapeutic regimen demonstrates tolerability, a second larger study improving the superiority of ciprofloxacin versus placebo can be initiated.",Crohn's Disease
NCT01336673,Glucophage XR® Observational Study,"This is a non-interventional, prospective study where no visits or additional interventions to the daily practice of the physician will be performed. Glucophage XR® has recently been available in Thailand for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. A prospective observational study will be valuable to provide information on the day-to-day experience of using Glucophage XR® in the management of this patient population. The data may provide an insight into the use of Glucophage XR® in routine clinical practice in Thailand.",Diabetes Mellitus Type 2|GI Side Effect
NCT03679273,Nutritional Supplement on Wound Healing in Diabetic Foot,"Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is the leading cause of non-traumatic limb loss in adult worldwide. One of the major causes of limb loss in patients with DFU is poor wound healing. It is known that nutrition plays a key role in wound healing, not only because of the required calories, but more importantly for collagen remodeling by specific amino acids (arginine, glutamine, and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate).Nevertheless, few studies have investigated nutritional supplements in patients with poor wound healing of DFU. Difficulties in assessing the severity of a wound and poor adherence to drug and food supplements at home may be important factors for the negative results shown in a most recent prospective randomized controlled trial. The diabetic foot center in Chang Gung Memorial hospital has extensive experience in caring for patients with limb-threatening DFU and we recently reported that poor nutritional status in our patients correlated to poor treatment outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and possible molecular mechanisms in nutritional treatment for limb-threatening DFU. A total of 70 patients will be enrolled and randomized into study and control groups. All subjects will receive standard care. Additional amino acid supplements containing arginine, glutamine, and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate or a control (high protein formula powder) will be given orally twice a day for 21 days, and the percentage change in wound size will then be measured. Complete healing time, recurrence or major adverse cardiac events will be recorded during one year of follow up. Data on wound size, nutritional status, and levels of matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, nutrient molecules (measured by ABSOLUTE/DQ P180 KIT (LC MS/MS) will be recorded before and after the nutritional supplementation. In addition, the pioneer factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) that binds native chromatin and bookmarks genomic regions for transcriptional activity may play a role in nutritional supplements in acute stressed diabetic patients. Therefore, we intend to conduct a pilot study on the for FOXA2 gene in maintaining glucose homeostasis in diabetic foot patients after nutritional interventions.",Diabetic Foot
NCT02390973,Surgery Versus Best Medical Management for the Long Term Remission of Type 2 Diabetes and Related Diseases (REMISSION),"Bariatric surgery procedures induce weight loss through restriction and/or malabsorption. The mechanisms underlying type 2 diabetes remission and others metabolic improvements after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) have not yet been formally studied. The investigators propose a longitudinal study with the overall objective of measuring the long-term impact of these three bariatric surgeries (RYGB, SG, BPD-DS) on metabolic, renal and cardiovascular fate in patients with type 2 diabetes. The investigators overall hypothesis is that some bariatric procedures generate hitherto unrecognized effects on many disease-related outcomes, which greatly contributes to their beneficial impact in diabetic patients. The investigators propose 3 specific aims: 1) to establish the long term effect of the three surgeries on the metabolic recovery and quality of life in groups of diabetic patients treated with insulin, hypoglycemic agents or diet; 2) to establish the long term impact of the three surgeries on renal and cardiovascular functions in subgroup of patients with these conditions; 3) to compare metabolic impact of surgeries to those of best medical care for diabetes in a non-surgical control group. For most severely obese patients, lifestyle interventions, perhaps effective in inducing short-lived weight losses, are ineffective for long-term weight loss maintenance and durable metabolic recovery. The increasing popularity of obesity surgeries calls for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This is especially true and urgent when considering that knowledge on the relative impact of each procedure (i.e. SG vs. RYGB and BPD-DS) in resolving T2D is still limited. Better knowledge on each of the procedures will allow stronger scientific rationale for selecting the right surgery for the right patient and improve care for the severely obese individual.",Bariatric Surgery Candidate|Diabetes
NCT05214573,Second-line Therapies for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Moderate Cardiovascular Disease Risk,"We will use the target trial framework for causal inference to conduct this observational retrospective cohort study that uses claims data of adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) included in the de-identified datasets of OptumLabs Data Warehouse (OLDW) and Medicare fee-for-service.In Aim 1, we will emulate a target trial comparing the effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), and sulfonylureas (SU) in adults with T2D at moderate risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with regard to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), expanded MACE, microvascular complications, severe hypoglycemia, and other adverse events.In Aim 2, we will compare these four drug classes in the same population of adults with T2D included in OLDW and Medicare fee-for-service data with respect to a set of composite outcomes identified by a group of patients with T2D as being most important to them. Specifically, in Aim 2A, we will prospectively elicit patient preferences toward various treatment outcomes (e.g., hospitalization, kidney disease) using a participatory ranking exercise, then use these rankings to generate individually weighted composite outcomes. Then, in Aim 2B, we will estimate patient-centered treatment effects of four different second-line T2D medications that reflect the patient's value for each outcome.In Aim 3, we will compare different medications within each of the four therapeutic classes with respect to MACE.",Type 2 Diabetes|Cardiac Disease
NCT05702931,Semaglutide Treatment for Hyperglycaemia After Renal Transplantation,"Background: Post-transplant hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in renal transplant recipients within the first two weeks after transplantation. Standard-of-care is primarily based on insulin treatment with the adherent risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain. Semaglutide produces an effective lowering of plasma glucose in diabetes patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and leads to a reduction in weight and the incidence of hypoglycaemia. The efficacy of semaglutide is untested in renal transplant recipients, and safety concerns remain, primarily on renal graft function.Objectives: The primary objective is to establish whether tablet semaglutide (Rybelsus) compared with placebo, both as add-on to standard-of-care, is non-inferior in regulating plasma glucose in patients with hyperglycaemia after renal transplantation. Secondary objectives aim to evaluate the effect of tablet semaglutide on renal graft function, weight, use of insulin, cardiovascular parameters and safety parameters (plasma semaglutide concentration, gastrointestinal side effects, dose of immunosuppressants).Design: An investigator-initiated, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel-group, randomised trial.Population: Patients (n = 104) with post-transplant hyperglycaemia and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \> 15 ml/min/1.73 m2.Methods: Participants diagnosed with post-transplant hyperglycaemia, 10 to 15 days post-transplant, will be randomised 1:1 to either 14 weeks of tablet semaglutide once daily or placebo both as add-on to standard glucose-lowering therapy. Participants will maintain weekly contact with the clinic during the first five weeks and at two to four weeks intervals during the remaining study period. During the trial, each patient will be monitored according to blood laboratory values with safety assessed at every visit by a nephrologist. Pre-prandial plasma glucose will be measured in the morning and evening to adjust glucose-lowering therapy after consultation with an endocrinologist. Double blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) will be performed for 10-14 days from baseline and at weeks 5, 9, and 13.Primary endpoint:- Mean sensor glucose (mmol/L) evaluated by CGMKey secondary endpoints:* Incidence of hypoglycaemia* Body weight (kg)* Creatinine (μmol/L)* Daily insulin dose (IE per day)* Plasma concentration of semaglutide (nmol/L)* Blood concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus (μg/L)",Hyperglycemia|Renal Transplant Complication Primary Non-Function|Diabetes
NCT05890131,Implementation of SGLT-2 Inhibitors in Patients With Heart Failure Through a New Digital Strategy,"The implementation of new medical therapies and guidelines, is a long and complex process that takes up to 10 years on average. This prolonged process is a global challenge and is mainly due to the complexity of cross-institutional patient care, involving primary care, out-patient clinics, nursing homes and patient associations.The main objective of this clinical trial is to determine whether a new digital strategy that employs official digital letters to inform and invite patients to evaluate their eligibility for new therapies, specifically the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor for heart failure patients, can facilitate and optimise the implementation. The aim is to increase the number of eligible patients with heart failure who start taking SGLT-2 inhibitors and reduce the time it takes to initiate treatment compared to the current process. Ultimately, this approach may improve patient outcomes.",Heart Failure
