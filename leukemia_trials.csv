NCT04223765,Study of Kappa Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Lymphocytes Co-Expressing the Kappa and CD28 CARs for Relapsed/Refractory Kappa+ Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma.,"This study will combine both T cells and antibodies in order to create a more effective treatment. The treatment tested in this study uses modified T-cells called Autologous T Lymphocyte Chimeric Antigen Receptor (ATLCAR) cells targeted against the kappa light chain antibody on cancer cells. For this study, the anti-kappa light chain antibody has been changed so instead of floating free in the blood, a part of it is now joined to the T cells. Only the part of the antibody that sticks to the lymphoma cells is attached to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way, it is called a chimeric receptor. The kappa light chain chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells are called ATLCAR.κ.28 cells. These cells may be able to destroy lymphoma cancer cells. They do not, however, last very long in the body so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.Previous studies have shown that a new gene can be put into T cells to increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes make up the chemical structure carrying your genetic information that may determine human characteristics (i.e., eye color, height and sex). The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes an antibody called an anti-kappa light chain. This anti-kappa light chain antibody usually floats around in the blood. The antibody can detect and stick to cancer cells called lymphoma cells because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called kappa light chains.The purpose of this study is to determine whether receiving the ATLCAR.κ.28 cells is safe and tolerable and learn more about the side effects and how effective these cells are in fighting lymphoma. Initially, the study doctors will test different doses of the ATLCAR.κ.28, to see which dose is safer for use in lymphoma patients. Once a safe dose is identified, the study team will administer this dose to more patients, to learn about how these cells affect lymphoma cancer cells and identify other side effects they might have on the body.This is the first time ATLCAR.κ.28 cells are given to patients with lymphoma. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has not approved giving ATLCAR.κ.28 as treatment for lymphoma. This is the first step in determining whether giving ATLCAR.κ.28 to others with lymphoma in the future will help them.",Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Follicular Lymphoma|Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Extranodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma of Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue|Nodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Indolent Non-hodgkin Lymphoma

NCT03902665,Up-front Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients Aged 65-75,"Patients with acute myeloid leukemia aged 65-75 have a very poor prognosis, irrespective of the treatment strategy, including demethylating agents or conventional chemotherapy. With these approaches, remission rates do not exceed 40%, and overall disease-free survival at 1 year is in the order of 15%.

NCT03967665,Risk Stratification-directed NAC for Prevention of Poor Hematopoietic Reconstitution,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective treatment of malignant hematopoietic diseases. However, poor hematopoietic reconstitution including poor graft function (PGF) and prolonged isolated thrombocytopenia (PT), remains a life-threatening complication after allo-HSCT. Especially with the increasing use of haploidentical allo-HSCT (haplo-HSCT) in the past ten years, PGF and PT have become growing obstacles contributing to high morbidity and mortality after allo-HSCT. Due to the limited mechanism studies, the clinical management of PGF and PT is challenging.Recent prospective case-control studies reported that the reduced and dysfunctional bone marrow (BM) endothelial cells (ECs) after allo-HSCT are involved in the pathogenesis of PGF and PT. Moreover, in vitro treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) could enhance the defective hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function through repairing the dysfunctional BM ECs of PGF and PT patients. The investigators performed a small-scale pilot cohort study and saw encouraging clinical results that oral administration with NAC could partially repair the dysfunctional BM ECs and improve megakaryocytopoiesis in PT patients, which suggests that NAC is a promising drug in PT patients after allo-HSCT. In addition, prior prospective trial of the investigators suggests that BM ECs\<0.1% pre-HSCT is the risk factor for occurrence of the PGF and PT two months following allo-HSCT. Previous single-arm clinical cohort studies of the investigators showed that prophylactic use of NAC before allo-HSCT reduced the incidence of poor hematopoietic reconstitution after allo-HSCT in patients with ECs \<0.1% pre-HSCT.Therefore, the investigators designed the study with acute leukemia patients who will be scheduled to receive haplo-HSCT. The patients who are in the first complete remission at time of haplo-transplant will be enrolled in the study. Exclusive criteria are bronchila asthma and NAC allergy. The enrolled patients were risk-stratified into BM ECs≥0.1% group (low-risk group) and BM ECs\<0.1% group (high-risk group). Patients in high-risk group (ECs\<0.1%) will be randomized to 1 of 2 arms: (a) NAC 400 mg three times per day from 14 days pre-HSCT to 2 months post-HSCT, (b) No-NAC concurrent control according to a 2:1 schedule. The aim of the trail is to assess the effects of NAC for prevention of poor hematopoietic reconstitution in patients with acute leukemia undergoing haplo-HSCT.",Stem Cell Transplant Complications

NCT06250465,AGMT Austrian CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia) Registry,"For until very recently CLL has been considered an uncurable disease, with the only few exceptions of a part of patients capable of undergoing and successfully standing allogeneic stem cell transplant. However, the introduction of chemoimmunotherapy in particular the FCR (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab) regimen has established a relevant population of IgVH mutated patients, who remain relapse-free for up to 10 years with a clear plateau at this level. However, for the largest proportion of all CLL patients the disease is still associated with a reduction in life expectancy as compared to a matched population.The field has made further substantial progress by the introduction of BTK inhibitors and Bcl2 inhibitors, novel antibodies as well as by the understanding of the role of minimal residual disease (MRD), mutations and their clonal evolution over time as risk factors and factors governing the kind and duration of therapy.Due to the limited follow up of frontline therapy trials using novel drugs, it is not yet clear, what the long-term results with many of the new drugs will be. Particularly, long-term PFS, the potential for cure and the long-term safety issues remain relevant parameters requiring examination, as are infections, interactions with other drugs or quality of life issues.CLL has not been systematically assessed in Austria to date.

NCT02172365,"Allogeneic SCT for CML, TKI Failure After TKI Failure","The investigators will evaluate the outcomes of allogeneic stem cell transplantation which is the only curative treatment modality in the patients with chronic myeloid leukemia after failing tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. However, any update was not reported on the transplant outcomes in the patients failed TKI therapy, thus necessitating update of this data. Also, the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) risk score is still of value, but insufficient numbers of patients have been transplanted in recent years and after TKI therapy to allow a robust reanalysis. Our study hypothesis is that allogeneic SCT treatment modality can rescue CML patients who failed TKI therapy due to resistance or to intolerance with improved survival and long-term outcomes.

NCT03262974,Effect of Pharmacogenetics on Imatinib Plasma Level and Response,"Imatinib, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is used for treatment of Philadelphia positive chronic myeloid leukemia.

NCT03971565,Evaluation of the Redox Profiles of Healthy and Pathological B Cells in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,"In recent years, considerable progress has been made in understanding the biology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), resulting in the emergence of new therapeutic agents that have significantly improved the long-term survival of patients. However, LLC is still considered an incurable disease.Cytogenetic abnormalities are frequently found in this pathology. Some abnormalities are associated with a more aggressive disease and a poor prognosis. The deletion of chromosome 17p (del (17p)), in particular, makes leukemic cells more resistant to standard therapy. Chromosome 17p contains the Tumor Protein 53 gene (TP53) which encodes the tumor suppressor protein 53 (P53) protein. P53 plays a central role in the regulation of important cellular functions such as DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and drug sensitivity of chemotherapies. In patients with CLL, the loss of p53 function is a major factor of chemoresistance and is associated with an adverse prognosis. The deletion (17p) is observed in approximately 5 to 10% of patients with CLL. In contrast, mutations in the TP53 gene are observed in approximately 30% of patients with CLL. This means that about one-third of patients with CLL have p53 dysfunction. TP53 and / or del (17p) mutated LLC cells show marked mitochondrial dysfunction. This dysfunction is responsible for a deregulation of intracellular redox phenomena, leading to an increase in oxidative stress and an overproduction of reactive oxygen derivatives (ROS).Dimethyl Ampal Thiolester (DIMATE) is an active, competitive and irreversible inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH) 1 and 3. In vitro, DIMATE eradicates human cells from acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). In patients with CLL, current treatments, particularly effective, do not specifically target pathological B cells. This results in chronic B lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemias that provide severe long-term infections, which is the leading cause of death in patients with CLL.Through this study, we will study, in vitro, the expression of ALDH 1, 3, 9 but also of glutathione (GSH) and ROS on tumor B lymphocytes and healthy patients carrying an LLC. Depending on the differences in expression observed, DIMATE could specifically eradicate leukemic lymphocyte cells by sparing healthy lymphocytes, a hypothesis that will be tested in vitro. A special evaluation will be made in patients with del (17) and / or TP53 mutation whose prognosis is still considered unfavorable despite new therapeutic advances.",Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
NCT06886074,Efficacy of Short-course Blinatumomab for MRD Erradication in B-ALL,"Detectable measurable residual disease (MRD) is the most important prognostic factor for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Patients who are MRD positive and have no access to novel immunotherapies should receive an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Blinatumomab is considered a standard of care (SOC) for this group of patients, however, the ideal treatment dose for MRD is unknown as doses were adjusted from the relapsed/refractory setting. Preliminary data suggest short cycles of blinatumomab can also be effective in states of lower disease burden prior to transplant. Thus, the investigators are performing a phase 2 trial assessing 7 days of blinatumomab as a bridge to HSCTPrimary endpoint is assessing the MRD response following a short-course blinatumomab infusion in patients with B-ALL with complete response (CR) and have detectable MRD disease who are candidates for HSCT.

NCT02828774,"Peptide-drug-conjugates for Personalized, Targeted Therapy of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia","Using phage libraries extensively pre-absorbed on a series of normal cell types, we will isolate phage specifically internalized by B-CLL cells from newly diagnosed and untreated CLL patients. Peptide sequences are then derived by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). NGS-based studies are contributing to an improved understanding of cancer heterogeneity in order to tailor treatment to patients based on the individual makeup of their tumor. However the use of NGS to derive phage displayed peptide sequences is so far rare (22). Traditionally, after exposure to a target and recovery by elution, the phage clones are isolated by titration on bacterial lawns. It is technically demanding and labour intensive to select and analyze more than about 15 of the sometimes thousands clones recovered. Therefore information on other potentially important sequences is missed. NGS allows sequencing of the entire recovered phage pool and provides far more detailed bioinformatic analyses of peptide sequences or motifs. RNA from the CLL cells is used for RNA-seq expression sequencing. The wide application of NGS in combination with bioinformatics tools has begun to revolutionize cancer research, diagnosis and therapy. The peptide and RNA sequencing data will afford bioinformatic testing of correlations of exome expression and clinical parameters with the pattern of peptide sequences internalized by CLL cells of different patients. This information is crucial to answering questions 1, 2 and 3 discussed on page 1 above. The results of this analysis will probably not allow identification of specific receptors targeted by the peptides. The aim at this stage of the research is to identify candidate targeting peptides. Once identified, further research will be needed to identify the receptors to which they bind. Regarding question 4, there is currently very little published information on the therapeutic potential of PDCs in leukemia. Using two peptides we have isolated that target murine A20 leukemic cells, we will prepare multi-drug PDCs (using technology we have developed) and in an animal model, test their ability to enhance the survival and quality of life of CLL bearing animals.",CLL

The rest may be done as an outpatient.Participants will get pembrolizumab at the beginning of each cycle through an IV.Participants will usually get decitabine by IV on days 8 12 and days 15 19 of every other cycle.Participants will give blood samples.Participants will have bone marrow exams. A needle will be inserted into the hip to extract cells from the bone marrow.Some participants may give a sample of saliva from the inside of their cheek.Some participants may give a small skin sample. The top layer of the skin is removed.Some patients may require leukapheresis before starting treatment. This is a procedure to remove leukemia cells in the blood stream.",Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia
NCT02451774,Pentoxifylline In Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia During Induction,"Recent advances in acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment are based on a cytotoxic drug combination. Measurement of minimal residual disease in bone marrow samples at day 14 of treatment is the most powerful early predictive indicator of further relapse, and it can be applied practically to all patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Even more so, it has been observed that patients who present negative minimal residual disease in bone marrow samples at day 7 during induction have a better prognosis than those achieving this at day 14.Relapse represents the main cause of treatment failure that related in the extreme with resistance to apoptosis, defining the latter as the principal mechanism of programmed cell death; it is also related with the induction of leukemic cells to senescent arrest.Pentoxifylline is a methyl-xanthine byproduct considered an unspecific inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. It inhibits nuclear factor-kappa-beta activation by different mechanisms and stimulates apoptosis induced by different drugs; thus, it can optimize the antineoplastic effect of actual treatments in order to increase the apoptosis of leukemic cells. This effect might improve the prognosis of these patients.Evaluate the safety and effect of Pentoxifylline together with antineoplastic drugs in order to study increased apoptosis and decreased senescence during the remission induction phase in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To achieve this propose, we will divide patients in two groups, who will receive pentoxifylline or placebo depending on the group, in addition to conventional treatment according to the protocol standard chemotherapy schema for pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at our institution during the remission induction phase. In addition, we will test whether the study group exerts an impact on reaching remission earlier as compared with the control group.",Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia
NCT02546674,Study Assessing Deep Molecular Response in Adult Patients With CML in Chronic Phase Treated With Nilotinib Firstline.,The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the rate of deep molecular response (MR4.5) after 24 months of therapy with nilotinib in newly diagnosed patients with chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) using EUTOS (European Treatment and Outcome Study for CML)-standardized laboratories. All participants received nilotinib 300 mg twice daily (BID).,Chronic Myeloid Leukemia
NCT04744974,Remotely Administered Diet Intervention to Impact Symptom Burden in Myeloproliferative Neoplasm,"Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN) is a chronic blood cancer without cure. The major clinical issues in MPN are 1) an increased risk of blood clots 2) symptoms thought to be driven by chronic inflammation which in some cases can be debilitating and 3) progression to acute leukemia. The current management of MPN focuses on preventing blood clots and relieving symptoms. However, treatments that reduce symptoms such as JAK inhibitors are limited to late stage MPN patients and have significant side effects including immunosuppression, reduction in platelets, and increased risk of skin cancer. Therefore, low risk interventions are sorely needed for MPN patients that can reduce symptoms. Diet represents a low risk way to reduce inflammation, specifically a Mediterranean diet has been found to reduce inflammation in cardiovascular disease. There has been a recently completed clinical trial that demonstrated MPN patients can adopt a Mediterranean diet if given dietician counseling and curriculum. However, in order to reach a larger group of people a fully remotely administered study is necessary. This is a feasibility study to determine.",Myeloproliferative Neoplasm
NCT02264574,A Multi-Center Study of Ibrutinib in Combination With Obinutuzumab Versus Chlorambucil in Combination With Obinutuzumab in Patients With Treatment naïve Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL),"The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with obinutuzumab compared to chlorambucil in combination with obinutuzumab based on the Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment of progression free survival (PFS). Efficacy will be evaluated according to 2008 International Workshop for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria with the modification for treatment-related lymphocytosis, in subjects with treatment-naive CLL or SLL.",Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Small-Cell Lymphoma
NCT04952974,B-cell Chronic Lymphoid Malignancies Markers,"Lymphoid chronic B-cell malignancies are frequent pathologies that affect adults, with a very variable prognosis and treatment (some of them can remain untreated). The diagnosis of these malignancies relies on the study of the morphology of tumoral cells and the expression by these cells of several markers, mainly via a technical approach called flow cytometry. Because the markers currently used remain imperfect, additional ones are needed for an accurate diagnosis that affect both prognosis and treatment.In addition, because numerous markers are used at the diagnosis, there is a need of tools that synthetize the multi-dimensional structure of the data obtained.The primary purpose of this study is to detect new markers that can be of help for the diagnosis of Marginal Zone Lymphoma and other B-cell chronic lymphoid malignancies.The secondary purpose of this study is to obtain a statistical algorithm that allow a good prediction of the different sub-types of chronic B-cell malignancies mainly using the results of flow cytometry.",Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/Waldenström Macroglobulinemia|Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Hairy Cell Leukemia|Follicular Lymphoma
